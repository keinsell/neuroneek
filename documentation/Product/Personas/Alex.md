Persona 7: "The Sober Curious"  
Name: Alex  
Age: 32  
Occupation: Graphic Designer  
Background: Alex is feeling burnt out and wants to explore a sober or semi-sober lifestyle. They've noticed that their alcohol consumption has increased over the past year, and they're not sure it's serving them anymore. They're curious about the potential benefits of reducing or eliminating alcohol from their life, such as improved sleep, mental clarity, and emotional well-being. Alex is looking for an app that can help them track their alcohol consumption, identify triggers, set goals for reducing their intake, and find support from others who are also exploring sobriety. They're also interested in learning more about the effects of alcohol on the body and mind, and finding healthy alternatives to cope with stress and socialize without relying on alcohol.
