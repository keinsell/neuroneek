- Defined how much of [[Substance]] is owned by [[Subject]]
- Traces change over time by relationships with [[Ingestion]]
- Can add additional metadata to possesion of some [[Substance]] such as purity, reagent results - eventually this should result in some middleware entity like InventorySubstance.
- Inventory should be E2E encrypted and system should not have access to any information stored by such entities (logs should be also redacted, just because I do not want to track what is legal where - even if I would be able this law is so fucking bad written you sometimes can count caffeine as drug with legal consequences)
