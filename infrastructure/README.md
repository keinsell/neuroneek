# Infrastructure

- **GitHub** for *Version Control System (VCS)*
- **Vercel** for *Serverless Deployments*, only for front-end bundles  as there's no real need to deploy back-end as serverless on Vercel.
- **Infisical** for *Secret Management*, where all the secrets for multiple environments will be stored.
