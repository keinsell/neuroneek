// Terraform managed Github Repository
//
// This is intended to manage deployment environments, secrets and overall configuration
// of organization as not everything can be done within CI/CD and I think
// forwarding secrets from infra to CI is more convenient than the other way
// around. At least I do not waste time configuring this shit every time, and
// ex. when database migration is made through CI/CD and rotation of keys on
// db is enabled things tend to get a little funky.
//
// I do not recommend defining repository from scratch on Terraform, however
// this can be easily resolved by:
// $ terraform import github_repository.terraform terraform
//
