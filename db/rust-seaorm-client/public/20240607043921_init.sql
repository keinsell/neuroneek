While some entities do not seem to be aware of a person''s presence, others are often precognizant of a person''s appearance into their realm and usually choose to interact with them in various ways. For example, they will often display behaviours such as showing a person around the realm that they inhabit, presenting them with objects, holding spontaneous celebrations of their arrival, engaging them in conversation, merging into and out of the person''s body or consciousness, and attempting to impart knowledge of various kinds.\n\nEntities can take any form, but certain archetypes are present and commonly include:\n\nHumans,\n\n[4]\n\n[9]\n\nshadow people, bodiless super intelligent humanoids, aliens,\n\n[4]\n\n[9]\n\nelves,\n\n[4]\n\nanimals,\n\n[4]\n\n[9]\n\ngiant spheres, insectoids,\n\n[4]\n\n[9]\n\nbeings of light, anthropomorphic beings,\n\n[4]\n\n[9]\n\nplants,\n\n[4]\n\n[9]\n\nconscious inanimate objects, fictional characters, cartoons, robotic machines, gods,\n\n[4]\n\ndemigods, goddesses, bio-mechanical intelligences, hooded figures, demons, indescribable monstrosities, spirits,\n\n[4]\n\nangels,\n\n[4]\n\nshamans, ghosts, souls, ancestors, fantastical or mythological beasts, glitch creatures, and more.\n\nThe appearance, personality, and behaviour of an autonomous entity often correlates with the psychological state of the person experiencing it.

However, it can also occur under the influence of stimulant psychosis, with extreme sleep deprivation, or during dreams.\n\nAutonomous entities can communicate with a person via a combination of spoken word, “telepathy”, conceptual thoughts, choreographed movements, mathematics, and geometry-based visual linguistics that generally consist of morphing coloured structures of different textures that are innately understandable as representations of specific concepts. They will often convey insights regarding overcoming personal issues within a person’s life and will occasionally help clarify philosophical or spiritual ideas. However, more often than not, entities are very likely to speak in a cryptic or nonsensical manner that seems to have no clear meaning behind it.\n\nIt is important to note that autonomous entities can never convey novel information to the person experiencing them. For example, they cannot provide insights about the external world that a person did not already know on some level. Instead, they can only provide alternative perspectives and help build upon existing ideas. This is presumably because autonomous entities do not have access to any knowledge not already contained within one''s conscious or subconscious memories.\n\nWhen communicated with through spoken word, the level of coherency in which these entities can communicate with is highly variable but can be broken down into five distinct levels. These are described and listed below:\n\nAutonomous entities will often embody at least one of a few approximate personality types. Although there is considerable overlap between them, these personality types can typically be identified primarily through their behaviour, their appearance, and an innate sense of their character that is often felt during the interaction.\n\nThe individual types are broken down and described within the four separate categories listed below:\n\nThis personality type can be described as a seemingly sentient representation of any hallucinatory character that the brain has either spontaneously generated during the trip or was already aware of at a prior time. These entities can include newly hallucinated characters of any sort, people that the person has met in real life, people that the person is aware of as existing in the real world, or characters from fictional media. These entities will usually adopt an appropriate personality and set of mannerisms to fit the chosen concept with an impressive degree of detail. An example of this might be meeting an insectoid mantis like creature that is playing the role of a shamanic teacher and acting accordingly. Another might include meeting the hallucination of a deceased loved one or a currently living family friend.\n\nThis personality type can be described as a seemingly sentient representation of any known concept or idea.

When interacted with, this category of entity can often possess abilities that allow them to directly alter and manipulate one’s current experiences.

It can take any visible form, but when conversed with, it clearly adopts an identical vocabulary and set of mannerisms to one’s own consciousness. This entity will often take on a similar appearance to oneself, but could theoretically take on any other appearance too.

Higher levels may also manifest itself in multiple voices or even an ambiguous collection of voices such as a crowd.\n\n[3]\n\nHowever, there are some subtle but identifiable differences between this experience and that of normal everyday conversations.

However, they can also occur to a lesser extent under the influence of cannabinoids, stimulant psychosis, and sleep deprivation.\n\nThis article focuses primarily on the types of delusion that are commonly induced with hallucinogens and other psychoactive substances. It therefore is not an exhaustive examination of all delusions listed within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) that are known to occur to people who suffer from chronic psychological conditions, such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.\n\nWhen associated with psychoactive substance use, delusions tend to occur during the peak of a substance’s effect, though they may also occur as a result of withdrawal from substances such as benzodiazepines. In contrast to disease-based delusions, substance-induced delusions are often ‘broken-out of’ after the duration of the substance’s effect, or when they are provided enough evidence to contradict their delusion. It is rare for a delusion to persist after the effects of a substance have waned.\n\nIt is difficult to clearly define the boundary between ‘normal’ beliefs and the delusions that occur while on psychoactive substances. In the context of psychoactive substance use, there is a discernible continuum between beliefs held while sober and the fully delusional beliefs held by those experiencing psychosis. Beliefs that are overvalued yet not delusional are commonly encountered at moderate substance intensity levels. Overvalued beliefs are those which are held with unusual fervency, but are not clearly absurd, such as the paranoid conviction that one’s friends are going to call emergency services imminently. With an increase in substance intensity overvalued beliefs can potentially develop into delusions proper.\n\nA common component to delusions and overvalued beliefs is a markedly increased sense of conviction in one’s beliefs. The intensity of this conviction roughly corresponds to the intensity of the substance’s effect. When conviction is increased, intuitive thinking is likewise increased, resulting in abnormally bold (and often tenuous) ideas and claims about science, metaphysics, politics, art and religion.\n\nAlthough substance-induced delusions can occur in myriad forms, they can be often categorized as belonging to particular types, the most common of which are documented and described below:\n\nGrandiose delusions are those where there is an inflated sense of personal accomplishment or status, possibly as a product of effects experienced while under the influence of psychedelics or stimulants, including ego-inflation, mania, geometry and internal hallucinations. These delusions persist for the duration of the substance’s effect, but will often be recognized as absurd upon obtaining sobriety.\n\nThe idea that one has ‘transcended to a higher level of being’ and is destined to solve the multitude of the world’s problems using extra-dimensional knowledge.\n\nThe idea that one has obtained an enlightened or god-like status comparable to The Buddha or Jesus and now comprehends the simple answer to life, the universe and everything. This individual may make claims that they have obtained a permanent enlightened status, eliminated their ego, and shall become historically noteworthy. This delusion is more common amongst users of short-acting ego death inducing hallucinogenic substances, such as DMT, nitrous oxide and salvia.\n\nThe idea that one has figured out, due to their supreme genius, the mathematical, scientific, and philosophical problems that no one before them could.\n\nThe idea that one has obtained an (often supernatural) ability that few others have. This may include abilities such as telepathy, levitation or willing the universe into producing particular outcomes.\n\nThe idea that one knows or can determine events that are bound to occur in the future. These predicted events can range from the mundane (‘My friend is going to call me.’) to the calamitous (‘Russia is about to invade the United States.’)\n\nWhile these delusions are most often applied to the individual who is undergoing the effects of the substance, they may also be applied to others, such as believing a close friend is in some way extraordinary. This projection may be influenced by a disparity in psychological states, such as that between those who are sober and those under the influence of a psychoactive substance.\n\nParanoid Delusions are delusions where there is a tremendous sense of fear and conviction that one is being watched, monitored, spied upon, and/or plotted against despite there being no evidence to substantiate such a claim.\n\nParanoid delusions are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of psychedelic compounds. However, they can also occur during extreme sleep deprivation and stimulant psychosis.\n\nSomatic Delusions are delusions that involve the belief that the body, or part of it, is missing, broken, deformed, diseased or dysfunctional. These beliefs are typically bizarre and are distinguished from tactile hallucination by seeming so real to the individual experiencing them as to cause significant emotional distress.\n\n*  The belief that one’s intestines are decomposing.\n\n*  That the tension in one’s throat is the result of the vocal cords becoming knotted.\n\n*  That there is a parasitic worm crawling around in one’s stomach.\n\n*  That a limb is dead, dying or missing.\n\nDelusions of Reference (also referred to as ideas of reference) are one of the most common types of delusion. This delusion typically involves the falsely held belief that an insignificant remark, event, coincidence, or object in the person''s environment is either a reaction to the individual or has significant personal meaning relating directly back to their life.\n\n[6]\n\n[7]\n\n[8]\n\nIn psychiatry, delusions of reference form part of the diagnostic criteria for illnesses such as schizophrenia, delusional disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizotypal personality disorder. To a lesser extent, they can also be a symptom of paranoid personality disorder. However, delusions of reference are especially common under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogens or during stimulant psychosis.\n\nA list of common examples of this type of delusion are described and documented below:\n\n*  Believing that people in a passing car are talking about you.\n\n*  Believing that people on television or in other forms of media are talking about or directly to you.\n\n*  Believing that headlines and news articles are written specifically for or about you.\n\n*  Believing that events (even world events) have been deliberately planned for you, or have special personal significance for you.\n\n*  Believing that the lyrics of a song are specifically about or for you.\n\n*  Believing that electronic devices are sending you secret and significant messages that only you are capable of understanding.\n\n*  Believing that objects, situations, and events are being deliberately organized to convey a special or particular meaning to you.\n\n*  Believing that the slightest  bodily movement of another person has a significant and deliberate meaning.\n\n*  Believing that posts on social media have hidden meanings pertaining to you.\n\nDelusions of Death & Dying are distressing, falsely-held beliefs that one is about to die, is currently dying, no longer exists, or has already died. This delusion may be a result of a diminished sense of self or identity that usually occurs during states of high-level ego death.\n\nThese delusions are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy doses of psychedelics and to a lesser extent dissociatives.\n\nDelusions of Guilt are caused by unfounded and intense feelings of remorse or guilt that lead the person to conclude that one must have committed some sort of deeply unethical act. The supposed unethical act can range from something relatively mild, such as the belief that the person has cheated on their partner; it can also be something much more serious, such as the belief that they have murdered their friends and family.\n\nDelusions of guilt are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of psychedelic and dissociative compounds.\n\nDelusions of reified fiction are the unfounded belief that something fictional, such as the plot of a TV show, film, video game, or book, is an actual real-life event. This delusion may manifest as the perception that the fictional events within media that is currently being consumed are genuinely occurring in one''s immediate vicinity, or simply that the events in the media are real and currently occurring somewhere in the world. This delusion seems to be a result of high-level immersion enhancement combined with memory suppression creating a state of mind in which somebody is highly engrossed in media while no longer having a functional long-term memory that can recall the difference between reality and fiction.\n\nDelusions of reified fiction are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of dissociative and occasionally psychedelic compounds.\n\nis the unfounded belief that the person is currently inside of a video game, dream, or movie and therefore their current actions will not have any real-life consequences. In extreme situations and depending on the person, this delusion can sometimes result in committing crimes or violent acts. It seems to be a result of intense psychosis, derealization, disinhibition and memory suppression combining to create an altered state of mind in which somebody mistakes reality for a fictional hallucination.\n\nDelusional derealization is most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogens and occasionally during stimulant psychosis.\n\nA delusion of sobriety typically involves the falsely held belief that one is perfectly sober despite obvious evidence to the contrary, such as severe cognitive impairment, significant motor control loss, and an inability to fully communicate with others.\n\nDelusions of sobriety are most commonly experienced under the influence of GABAergic compounds such as alcohol and benzodiazepines. However, in many cases, this state of mind can stem not just from the delusional belief of one''s own sobriety, but also from a sense of denial that is motivated by a need to protect one''s ego, or a genuine inability to identify one''s own intoxication.\n\nA delusion of permanent unsobriety is the belief that has permanently changed the operation of their mind and will remain in an unsober state. This can also manifest as a fear that one has broken their brain through substance abuse, despite there being no convincing evidence to substantiate such a claim.\n\nDelusions of permanent unsobriety are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of dissociative and occasionally psychedelic compounds.\n\nShared delusions are when a delusional belief is experienced in a group setting and it begins to spread between individuals who are similarly intoxicated.\n\n[4]\n\nFor example, if one person makes a verbal statement regarding a delusional belief that they are currently holding while in the presence of other similarly intoxicated people, they may also begin to hold the same delusion. This can result in shared hallucinations and a general reinforcement of the level of conviction in which they are each holding the delusional belief.\n\nShared delusions are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of psychedelic compounds.\n\nDelusional parasitosis, also known as Ekbom''s syndrome,\n\n[13]\n\n[14]\n\nis a form of delusion in which victims acquire a strongly held belief that they are infested with parasites, bugs, and insects, whereas in reality, no such parasites are present.\n\n[15]\n\nSufferers may injure themselves in attempts to rid themselves of the "parasites." Some are able to induce the condition in others through suggestion, in which case the term "folie à deux" may be applicable.\n\n[14]\n\n[16]\n\nDuring this state, nearly any marking upon the skin, small object or particle found on the person or their clothing can be interpreted as evidence for the parasitic infestation. If this delusion is ongoing, sufferers may compulsively gather such "evidence" and then present it to medical professionals when seeking help.\n\n[17]\n\nIn the context of psychoactive substances this effect is common during stimulant psychosis, often after chronic usage of cocaine or methamphetamine.\n\n[18]','\n',char(10)),'','','https://www.effectindex.com/effects/delusion','https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Runny_nose');

However, differentiating normal sadness/grief from a depressive episode requires a careful and meticulous examination. For example: the death of a loved one may cause great suffering, but it does not typically produce a medically defined depressive episode.\n\n[1]\n\nWithin the context of psychoactive substance usage, depressivity is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as anxiety, irritability and dysphoria. It is most commonly induced through prolonged chronic stimulant or depressant use, during the withdrawal symptoms of almost any substance, or during the comedown/crash of a stimulant. It is associated specifically with higher alcohol consumption.\n\n[4]\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that substance-induced depressivity is often much shorter lasting than clinical depression, usually subsiding once the effects or withdrawal symptoms of a drug have ended.\n\nIf you suspect that you are experiencing symptoms of depression, it is highly recommended to seek out therapeutic medical attention and/or a support group. Additionally, you may want to read our depression reduction effect and Psychedelic Therapy review.\n\nIt is worth noting that depression as an effect has an unfortunately non-specific definition. It is due to this that there are a number of other relevant terms which should be taken into account when trying to understand this state of mind. These are listed and described below:\n\nDepressivity is medically recognized as feelings of being intensely sad, miserable, and/or hopeless. Some patients describe an absence of feelings and/or dysphoria; difficulty recovering from such moods; pessimism about the future; pervasive shame and/or guilt; feelings of inferior self-worth; and thoughts of suicide and suicidal behavior.Depressive symptoms may include fatigue, lack of ability to concentrate, or significant changes in weight or sleep.\n\nMajor Depressive Disorder (MDD) is medically recognized as discrete episodes of depressivity lasting at least two weeks (although most episodes last considerably longer).\n\n[1]\n\nThis is the traditional characterization for the term medical term depression.\n\nDysthymia is medically recognized as a chronic major depressive disorder and is typically diagnosed after two years of continued mood disturbance.\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\nAcute depressivity (colloquially referred to as "feeling depressed"), when indicated by either self-report or observation made by others, encompasses the following symptoms:\n\n*  Feeling intensely sad, miserable, and/or hopeless along with pessimism about the future.\n\n*  Anhedonia: a markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.\n\n*  Inability to sleep or sleeping too much.\n\n*  Feelings worthless or excessive/inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional)\n\n*  Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying).\n\n*  Recurrent suicidal ideation: without a specific plan, having a plan, or a suicide attempt.\n\nFor a diagnosis of major depressive disorder to be accurate, the symptoms must cause readily observable distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning for an extended period of time. The episode must not be better explained by a different mood disorder. The symptoms also cannot be attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the studies referenced here will refer to Depression as it is traditionally defined in medical and scientific literature AKA Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).\n\nMajor depression affects 5-20% of the population at some point in their life.\n\n[3]\n\nIt results from the combination of genetics and environments with a heritability of greater than 30%. Common environmental influences (parenting style, socioeconomic status, or local environmental qualities) are quite small; however this does not mean these influences are irrelevant. What seems to matter is how a specific individual interacts with their environment across developmental stages.\n\n[5]\n\nStressful life events are significantly associated with depression.\n\n[6]\n\nDepression is a life-threatening disorder. Both depression and subclinical depression increase all-cause mortality similarly;\n\n[7]\n\n[8]\n\nhowever subclinical depression does not have an exact definition yet (making it harder to study). The impact depression has on quality of life is comparable or greater than other chronic medical illnesses.\n\n[3]\n\nCognitive impairment is a core feature of depression that remains after remission and cannot be considered a result of low mood.\n\n[9]\n\n[10]\n\nAlthough there is some evidence associating depressivity and functionality, depression severity accounts for -at most- 10% of the variability in cognitive dysfunction. Both age of onset and depression severity also modify this effect’s magnitude and what cognitive deficits arise.\n\n[11]\n\nAs a generality (not developed in parallel), more severe depression correlates with significant decreases in cognitive performance.\n\n[9]\n\n[11]\n\nThese cognitive deficits are significantly associated with poor psychosocial functioning (psychological factors combined with the surrounding social environment).\n\nPsychosocial impairment is also a core feature of depression that remains after remission. Psychosocial stressors are associated with the onset, severity, and progression of MDD.\n\n[12]\n\nMore severe depression can be considered a disability, or disorder, of psychosocial function.\n\n[3]\n\nEven brief psychosocial interventions in the form of collaborative care (e.g. a telephone call reminding to take medication) may be comparably effective to more intensive forms of face-to-face psychotherapy.\n\n[13]\n\nImproving cognitive deficits may also improve psychosocial functioning. Although impaired attention and executive functions remain in patients whose depressive symptoms alleviate, memory functions may improve to only a small deficit.\n\n[9]\n\nImprovements in mood are most closely related to improvements in verbal memory, verbal fluency, and psychomotor speed.\n\nDepression is accompanied by immune system dysregulation and activation of the body’s inflammatory response system.\n\n[3]\n\n[7]\n\n[14]\n\nSpecific biomarkers have small but significantly higher concentrations associated with the incidence and severity of depression.\n\nIt is difficult to say how biological sex interacts due to increasing the number of females in a sample causing the relationship between depression and inflammation to become nonsignificant.\n\n[7]\n\nEstrogen interacts with CRP and IL6, thus fluctuations in menstrual cycles and hormonal contraceptives may affect these results. Yet, overall the fundamental genetic architecture appears the same across samples and genders.\n\n[5]\n\nThese proinflammatory small protein messengers, called cytokines, increase indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression in both central and peripheral immune-competent cells. IDO increases the synthesis of kynurenine from dietary tryptophan, so this may cause a decrease in tryptophan availability. Tryptophan is required to synthesize serotonin and melatonin.\n\n[3]\n\nAdditionally, there is no evidence the serotonin transporter genotype alone or in interaction with stressful life events is associated with an elevated risk of depression.\n\n[6]\n\nKynurenine also produces endogenous NMDA agonist metabolites that could disrupt neurotransmission along glutaminergic pathways and lead to excitotoxicity in the form of hippocampal neuron damage/death.\n\n[3]\n\nWithin the central nervous system, proinflammatory cytokines play important roles in the body’s stress response system and within the regulation of neurogenesis.\n\n[3]\n\nStress response is mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.The HPA axis allows organisms to adapt to physical and psychosocial changes in their environments. There is a substantial link between MDD and HPA abnormalities and it is well established that approximately half of depressed patients have HPA axis hyperactivity.','\n',char(10)),'','','https://www.effectindex.com/effects/depression','https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression');

In many cases, it may also stem from the direct neurological changes that occur as a result of a substances’ pharmacological action.\n\nEuthymia most commonly occurs at varying levels of efficacy under the influence of a range of different substances, primarily psychedelics in combination with psychotherapy\n\n[30]\n\n[31]\n\n, or dissociatives.\n\n[26]\n\nHowever, it can also occur throughout the course of prescribed psychiatric medications and under the influence of certain entactogens.\n\nA 2021 meta analysis examined 12 double-blind randomized controlled trials for classical psychedelics treating depressive symptoms.\n\n[30]\n\nA single-dose in combination with a psychotherapy treatment program created moderate to large reductions in negative mood symptoms. This reduction remained consistent at several intervals throughout the examined time-frame of 3 hours to 60 days; there were simply not enough randomized clinical trials to extend their timeframe. This effect was present in both healthy and disordered patients.\n\nA 2020 meta analysis examined 9 placebo-controlled studies for psychedelic psychotherapy.\n\n[31]\n\nThe studies had one to three doses in combination with a psychotherapy treatment program and results were measured several times over the course of 6 months. The authors'' effect size indicated an 80% probability that a randomly selected patient receiving psychedelic psychotherapy outperforms a patient receiving placebo. Additionally, there were no incidents of severe adverse effects. The authors even compared their results to other meta analyses examining "gold standard" treatments for several mental health problems: psychedelic psychotherapy greatly outperformed.\n\nPsychotherapy with 1-3 doses of a classical psychedelic greatly outperforms current pharmacological standards in regards to producing a depression reduction all while having minimal to no adverse effects. The benefits of only needing a single dose over the course of 6 months as opposed to a daily administration of a substance incurring larger side effects and not producing desired effects until the 2-4 week mark appear obvious.\n\nScheduling activities is a behavioral treatment for depression that appears as effective as other psychological or pharmacological treatments.\n\n[10]\n\nThere is a significant relationship between mood and the number of pleasant activities engaged in. Depressed individuals find fewer activities pleasant, engage in pleasant activities less frequently, and obtain less positive reinforcement.\n\nExercise is an evidence-based treatment for depression.\n\n[11]\n\n[12]\n\n[13]\n\n[14]\n\n[23]\n\nIt also has the advantage of preventing the increased risk of drug-drug interactions. Moderate to heavy exercise of any type (including yoga) appears as effective, and do not significantly differ from, other pure forms of depression treatment such as psychotherapy or pharmacological treatment. Large changes in fitness do not appear necessary either.\n\nWARNING\n\n[27]\n\n[28]\n\n- Ketamine possesses a strong abuse potential at typical antidepressive doses. Ketamine has reported cases of severe bladder and liver injury. Esketamine, a newer nasal spray formulation of Ketamine, does not have any reported cases and is purported to have a better safety profile. However, in recent short-term clinical trials esketamine still more-than-doubled the amount of adverse bladder events when compared to placebo (6-10% vs 1-4%).  Although 2/3 of esketamine incidents resolved themselves either without intervention or through a lowering of dosage, any physiological damage is acute and immediate: in typical dose regimens steady-state concentrations are not reached.\n\nKetamine offers a (dose-dependent) large immediate depression reduction for 30-50% of patients; its effect-sizes become moderate to small by day 7.\n\n[24]\n\n[25]\n\n[29]\n\nWeekly to biweekly dosing maintains a statistically significant depression reduction measured at Day 28 and repeated administration has resulted in cases of euthymia.\n\n[26]\n\n[28]\n\nA family history of alcohol-use-disorder in a first-degree relative is associated with an improved antidepressive response, and a reduction of adverse mental effects such as dysphoria. Its antidepressant properties may also stem more generally from dissociatives'' novelty and/or immersion enhancements.\n\nThere is no doubt Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is an effective treatment for adult depression.\n\n[15]\n\nThere are no large differences in efficacy between major psychotherapies for mild to moderate depression.\n\n[16]\n\nThere is also a large body of evidence supporting computerized care, and psychoeducational interventions.\n\n[17]\n\n[18]\n\n[19]\n\n[20]\n\n[21]\n\nFor patients with mild or moderate depression in natural settings, antidepressant relapse rate is high.

During this phase of my life, my entire circle of friends had taken to no longer bothering to brew mimosa hostilis root bark over the course of several hours into a foul tasting liquid, but were instead simply blending the product into a fine, stringy powder and masking it within banana smoothies. In conjunction with Syrian Rue taken 45 minutes beforehand, this worked incredibly well and allowed all of us to use ayahuasca in a surprisingly accessible and casual manner. On this particular night, it was my friends birthday and the two of us were planning on tripping together to celebrate it. However, when we finally got around to consuming the root bark smoothie, a single tiny strand of the root bark immediately got stuck in the back of my throat on the first sip and made me almost vomit to the point where I knew that I could not drink any further and would not be tripping tonight. I had consumed what I would estimate to be less than 1% out of what was likely in the 15 gram range of material.\n\nHowever, as we waited for my friend to come up on what was quite a heavy dosage, I began to notice that I was also coming up at the same rate and intensity as him. I was experiencing incredibly intense geometry to the point where I was having trouble seeing the room around me, alongside intense visual distortions and a multitude of cognitive effects. While this was happening, I heard a voice in my head tell me that I was being allowed to trip at this level despite my miniscule dosage because it was my friends birthday and that it would be more conducive for him to have an enjoyable evening if we were both tripping. At the time, this absolutely blew my mind and continues to baffle me to this very day.\n\nWhile I am not sure what could have caused this experience, I suspect it was because I had used ayahuasca several times before and that despite the dosage, some sort of unknown subconscious process was apparently both present and actively capable of allowing that door in my mind to open regardless. From what I have gathered, other accounts of this seem to follow similar themes that, in my opinion, have some potentially interesting implications in regards to how the subconscious mind can impact a psychedelic experience and to what extent.

To treat this condition, substances such as cevimeline which stimulate the release of saliva are typically used.

Dry mouth as an effect of substances is considered to be benign unless the effect is chronic and continues to bother or cause tooth/gum issues in the person experiencing it.

During this experience, the person will often find themselves experiencing overwhelming fear and anxiety relating to the fear of losing control. This fear and anxiety is especially common in those who have not experienced ego death before.\n\nTo overcome this fear, it is recommended that the person does their best to stop fighting the loss of control, and simply surrender themselves to the experience of ego death. Upon successfully relaxing into ego death, the person will often experience a radical and positive change in their emotional state.\n\nEgo death is well known for the transformative and significant impacts it can have on a person''s perception of both themselves and the world around them. These responses and alterations can occur during the experience of ego death, but also in the hours, days, or weeks afterwards.\n\nA few of the most common examples of this phenomenon are described and listed below:\n\nWithin the context of psychedelic use, ego death is most commonly triggered at heavy doses by states of high level memory suppression which causes the person to forget who they are. At other times it can be triggered by or in combination with sensory overload consuming the person''s consciousness with information and overwhelming their sense of self.\n\nWithin the context of dissociative use, ego death seems to be triggered at heavy doses by increasingly intense cognitive disconnection causing a person to become dissociated from cognitive functions such as the maintenance of a sense of identity.\n\nPsychedelic ego death usually occurs alongside states of level 6-7 geometry and internal hallucinations of an intense and often overwhelming nature. It may synergize with other coinciding effects such as personal bias suppression, unity and interconnectedness, spirituality enhancement, and delusions. These accompanying effects further elevate the subjective intensity and transpersonal significance of ego death experiences.\n\nDissociative ego death usually occurs alongside high level sensory disconnection and out of body experiences which may take place within voids or holes filled with hallucinatory structures. Dissociative ego death is less likely to cause an anxious response for those who are inexperienced compared to psychedelic ego death. This is because many people experience dissociatives as inherently calming and tranquil while high doses of psychedelics are quite often experienced as the opposite.\n\nOutside of psychedelics and dissociatives, it is also possible to experience ego death under the influence of a few other classes of psychoactive compounds. For example, extremely heavy doses of deliriants such as DPH or datura can result in ego death that is accompanied by delusions, psychosis, and external hallucinations. Heavy doses of salvia divinorum are extremely effective at inducing ego death that is accompanied by bizarre internal hallucinations, autonomous entity contact, and machinescapes. Although these two classes of hallucinogens function very differently on both a subjective and neuropharmacological level, both of their variations on ego death feel as if they stem from a break down or deterioration in the brain''s ability to maintain normal levels of cognitive functioning.','\n',char(10)),'','','https://www.effectindex.com/effects/ego-death',NULL);

Almost a decade ago as a young 17-year-old undergoing my first couple of hallucinogenic experiences, I found myself immediately fascinated by the sheer incomprehensibility of the beautiful patterns which my mind was producing. Not only were these geometric patterns complex beyond anything I had ever seen, but they were so impossibly complex in their forms that I perhaps naively believed if even a short recording of high-level geometry could be somehow brought back to the real world, it would change the face of society forever.\n\nBased on my personal experiences, I firmly believe that geometry is not simply another form of hallucination, but instead a result of neurological signals and processes from various regions of the brain bleeding into the visual cortex and being reinterpreted as complex geometric forms in a manner which is comparable to that of synaesthesia. This would explain multiple aspects of the effects behaviour, such as the way in which geometry commonly feels as if it is an innately understandable visual representation of one''s emotional state, sensory input, and even complex concepts or thoughts. If this is true, it implies that psychedelic geometry is the profound experience of being able to indirectly see the hidden architecture and complex programming of human consciousness.\n\nAnother aspect of geometry that myself and others have found very intriguing is that psychedelic geometry often follows the aesthetic themes of various artwork and writing styles from historical societies, such as Aztecs, Mayans, Egyptians, Tibetans, etc.\n\nBased purely upon my own potentially flawed speculation, there are a couple of relatively plausible explanations behind this. Perhaps our culture simply associates psychedelia with mysticism and ancient societies in a manner which results in these themes displaying themselves within our collective experience of psychedelic geometry. Perhaps these societies experienced the very same imagery under the influence of psychedelic plants and took inspiration from this within their artwork, architecture, and alphabets. Maybe psychedelic geometry manifests itself in a manner which is, on some level, a visual representation of the same neurological processes that allowed ancient humans to create language and artwork in the first place, thus generating a variety of somewhat consistent aesthetic themes throughout the humans that experience them, regardless of their cultural or historical context.\n\nNevertheless, none of these speculative ideas feel particularly satisfactory to me, but I do still hope that this particular aspect of psychedelic geometry is more closely examined and understood on a a scientific level within my lifetime.','\n',char(10)),'','','https://www.effectindex.com/effects/geometry','https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry');

These can be described as spontaneous moving or still images of scenes, concepts, places, or anything one could imagine. The imagery is manifested in varying levels of realism ranging from ill-defined and cartoon-like to wholly realistic. They rarely hold their form for more than a few seconds before fading or shifting into another image. It is worth noting that this level of intensity occurs in a manner similar to that of hypnagogia, the state between sleep and wakefulness.\n\nAt higher levels, internal hallucinations become increasingly elaborate as they eventually become all-encompassing, fully-fledged 3D scenes that surround the person in a manner similar to that of dreams. This can create the feeling that one has "broken-through" into another reality. The things that occur within this perceived alternate reality can be anything, but fall under common archetypes such as contact with autonomous entities, alongside a wide variety of imagined landscapes and scenarios.\n\nThis effect is capable of manifesting itself across the 5 different levels of intensity described below:\n\nOutside of this levelling system, the subjective intensity of internal hallucinations are not only dependent on their detail or level of immersion, but also upon the speed and rate at which they successively occur between each other. For example, during the experience of internal hallucinations, it is possible to find oneself in a state that presents a relentless stream of intensely vivid hallucinations. This occurs at such a rapid rate that it eventually becomes psychologically exhausting to endure them, regardless of their thematic content. The sheer amount of content experienced in this state often results in powerful time dilation, which seems to stem from the fact that abnormally large amounts of experiences are being felt in very short periods of time. This is also consistently accompanied by states of sensory overload and ego death in a manner that can subjectively feel as if it is a consequence of the brain allocating all of its processing power into rendering hallucinations at the expense of other cognitive faculties.\n\nThe content within these internal hallucinations can be further broken down into four distinct sub-components. These are described and documented within their own dedicated articles, each of which are listed below:\n\nIt is worth noting that the content, style, and general behaviour of an internal hallucination is often largely dependent on the emotional state of the person experiencing it. For example, a person who is emotionally stable and generally happy will usually be more prone to experiencing neutral, interesting, or positive hallucinations. In contrast, however, a person who is emotionally unstable and generally unhappy will usually be more prone to experiencing sinister, fear-inducing, and negative hallucinations.\n\nInternal hallucinations are often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as geometry, external hallucinations and delusions.

However, in my personal opinion, it is quite likely to be one of the most uniquely baffling and inexplicable effects when it comes to both undergoing it and considering the causes behind it. While I may not have a particularly in-depth academic knowledge of neurology and psychopharmacology, the vast majority of subjective effects that occur under the influence of hallucinogenic substances at least have some sort of vaguely plausible mechanism or cause that I can immediately speculate upon. In contrast, however, I have struggled for years to come up with a satisfying hypothesis on why Salvia Divinorum can cause human brains to quite reliably create states in which a person''s awareness and felt bodily form suddenly becomes enveloped by rotating panels, conveyer belts, pulleys, gears, and all manner of other interlocking mechanical parts.\n\nAt face value, I would initially assume that machinescapes are simply a type of hallucination that occurs among people as a result of the cultural influence of living in a world in which we are all acutely aware of the existence of machinery. However, the fact that this experience is so consistently reported by people under the influence of a very specific compound leads me to believe that there is at least a little more to it than that. This is especially interesting to consider in the context of Salvia Divinorum''s unique pharmacology, in which it functions as a potent k-opioid receptor agonist. While the k-opioid receptor system is not well understood, it is known that these receptors have the highest prevalence within the claustrum, a system that is the most densely connected structure in the brain and that''s been shown to have widespread activity throughout numerous cortical components. These are associated with playing key roles in consciousness, higher cognitive functioning, and sustained attention. It is further theorised that the claustrum harmonises and coordinates activity in various parts of the cortex in a manner that leads to the seamlessly integrated nature of subjective conscious experience. All of this suggests to me that this unique hallucinogen is creating disruptions and changes to brain function that occur on a much deeper, widespread, and fundamental level than that of psychedelics, dissociatives, and deliriants.\n\nWhen taking this knowledge into consideration, I am led to suspect that machinescapes may occur under the influence of salvia due to the way this substance reliably disrupts consciousness on an all-encompassing level. If I had to guess I would say that this could potentially cause the experience of machinescapes to occur in a number of ways. For example, perhaps it causes the brain''s internal map of the bodies form to reassemble in complex and unpredictable ways, which are then accompanied by visual hallucinations that are commonly interpreted as interlocking mechanical parts. It may also trigger data from various parts of the brain to spill over into areas in unusual and complex ways, that they would usually otherwise not, resulting in this data being interpreted as a more simplistic but mechanical-esque equivalent to psychedelic geometry accompanied by an equivalent tactile sensation. It could also potentially be a unique form of internal hallucination that the brain will often render when it is largely incapable of drawing from its memory database of more coherent everyday concepts. Alternatively, however, this experience may be a result of a combination of these factors, or an entirely different process altogether. Unfortunately, none of these speculative ideas feel particularly satisfactory to me and I also sincerely doubt that the causes behind this incredibly niche experience will be understood at a scientific level within my lifetime.','\n',char(10)),'','','https://www.effectindex.com/effects/machinescapes','https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes');

These various different classifications are described and documented below:\n\n*   This is when one emotion appears first and is then replaced by a second emotion without either of the emotions occurring simultaneously.\n\n*   This is when the two emotions occur simultaneously but, throughout the emotional episode, one is of moderate or high intensity while the other is of very comparatively low intensity.\n\n*   This is when the two emotions occur in an inverse fashion; that is, while the intensity of one emotion progressively decreases as the intensity of the other emotion proportionally increases.\n\n*   This is when both emotions are of moderate or high intensity and the two occur simultaneously, whether throughout the entirety of the emotional episode or simply during a portion of it.\n\nIt is worth noting that mixed emotions are a complex subjective experience and not merely a collection of independent feelings elicited in response to separate triggers. Although people can usually identify the environmental triggers responsible for their mixed emotions, the subjective feeling reflects the simultaneous occurrence of both positive and negative emotions. It can therefore be said that this state of mind is more than the sum of the emotions involved; mixed feelings are in themselves a distinct and integral emotional experience.','\n',char(10)),'','','https://www.effectindex.com/effects/mixed-emotions',NULL);

I truly felt that not only was I the entirety of existence experiencing itself through this body, but that this moment and all other moments would continue to exist eternally within their specific time frames. Although I am acutely aware of how it is impossible for me to genuinely know if this is true or not, I have found it to be a perspective that is very difficult to shake off after having this experience a number of times.\n\nBefore experiencing this effect, I had never considered or even heard of the various similar metaphysical schools of thought that exist as relatively mainstream concepts within the field of philosophy. However, after having had experienced this state of mind numerous times, I happened upon a large number of relevant concepts that include ideas such as eternalism, four dimensionalism, growing block universe, perdurantism, and the b-theory of time. Each of these concepts have their Wikipedia articles linked to within the See Also section of this page.\n\nAs an intellectual concept, the B-theory of time is especially interesting to me as it is relatively well supported by the physics community. In summary, B-theory posits that the flow of time is an illusion, that the past, present, and future are equally real and that time is tenseless. Its support is seemingly due to its apparent compatibility with theoretical physics and the fact that many theories such as special relativity, the ADD model, and brane cosmology are considered to point to a theory of time similar to B-theory. However, I feel that it is important to note that I do not have a remotely in-depth understanding of theoretical physics and that although these theories are in support of notions similar to this experience, I am not entirely sure that their ontological implications can be asserted within science and outside the realm of philosophy or metaphysics.\n\nRegardless of whether or not the nature of time is genuinely illusory, it is truly fascinating to me that without any prior knowledge, myself and many other psychedelic users can experience incredibly specific states of mind that seem to line up with entire philosophical theories.

For example, at the end of hallucinogenic experiences which typically last no longer than several hours, one may feel that they have subjectively undergone days, weeks, months, years, or even infinite periods of time.\n\nTime dilation is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as spirituality enhancement, novelty enhancement, thought loops, novelty enhancement, and internal hallucinations. This is seemingly because these particular effects can result in a person perceiving a disproportionately large number of novel events occurring within a much smaller frame of time than they usually would.\n\nTime dilation is most commonly induced under the influence of strong dosages of hallucinogenic compounds, such as psychedelics\n\n[6]\n\n, dissociatives\n\n[7]\n\n, and cannabinoids\n\n[8]\n\n.

With these particular substances, time compression seems to at least partially stem from the fact that during intense levels of stimulation and focus-enhancement, people typically become hyper-fixated on activities and tasks in a manner that causes them to both keep track of time less effectively and also become more likely to ignore any events which may be unfolding around them.\n\nHowever, the same experience also commonly occurs in a different manner while under the influence of depressant compounds which induce amnesia, such as alcohol, GHB, and benzodiazepines. This is seemingly due to the way in which a person can forget events that occurred under the influence of the particular substance, thus giving the impression that they have suddenly jumped forward in time.\n\nTime reversal is the experience of perceiving the events that occurred around oneself within the previous several minutes or several hours, spontaneously playing backwards in a manner similar to that of a rewinding VHS tape. During this reversal, the person''s cognition and train of thought typically continues to play forward in a coherent and linear manner while they watch the external environment around them and their body''s physical actions play in reverse. It is speculated that the experience of time reversal may potentially occur through a combination of visual hallucinations and errors in memory encoding.\n\nTime reversal is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as internal hallucinations, thought loops, and deja vu. It is most commonly induced under the influence of extremely heavy dosages of hallucinogenic compounds, such as psychedelics, dissociatives, and deliriants.\n\nAtemporality is the experience of feeling as if one''s conscious awareness is now outside of, disconnected from, and uninfluenced by the normal passage of linear time. During this state, there is often a sense that the flow of time has ceased to function and has also become inherently meaningless.\n\nWhile experiencing atemporality, one’s ability to conceptualize ordinary time may be compromised in several ways. For example, the concept of ‘one hour’ may no longer make any sense. As a different example, the concepts of ‘one second’ and ‘one year’ may both seem like a single well-defined unit. The paradoxical sensation of ‘existing’ outside of time is also often connected to reports of being unable to adequately describe this effect using ordinary language.\n\nAtemporality is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as perception of eternalism and ego death.

I have been fascinated by this effect for around a decade now and first came to learn of its existence as a teenager through the numerous first hand accounts given to me by my close friends. This effect was further solidified in my mind as something of extreme significance after I found the works of Alan Watts through his philosophical lectures and writings. I then proceeded to dive headfirst into meditation and obsessively contemplating the supposedly illusory nature of the self on a daily basis. I even found that on more than one occasion, I could lead people into experiencing states of high level unity by simply saying the right words to them during heavy psychedelic trips.\n\nHowever, despite my borderline obsession with this subjective effect and its associated philosophical frameworks, I found that no matter how heavy a dosage of a psychedelic I consumed, I could never experience this state of mind for myself. This led me to the conclusion that regardless of how common an occurrence this effect was for many other experienced psychedelic users, my extreme fascination with it must be the exact thing that is preventing me from experiencing it for myself. This caused me to inevitably let my guard down for what was to come. Approximately two years later while under the influence of ayahuasca, I spontaneously found myself undergoing a state of level 4 unity for the first time in my life. This happened on two separate occasions within a month and, at the time, were by far the most profound and lifechanging psychedelic experiences I had ever undergone in my entire life.\n\nIn the years after these two experiences, I have since undergone states of unity on two other occasions, both of which were under the influence of 4-HO-MET and also less than a month apart. These experiences seemingly came out of nowhere and I cannot for the life of me understand or figure out any causal factors or correlations behind the triggering of this state of mind.  As far as I can tell, it seems that certain individuals are much more prone to it than others, but almost everybody will inevitably experience this if they trip regularly enough over a long period of time. It does not seem to be dependent on the dosage or the psychedelic in question, although set and setting seems to be at least somewhat of a factor. Situations involving beautiful nature, deep contemplation, and philosophical conversation can often cause it to come about, but not in a reliable or reproducible fashion. It therefore seems that states of unity and interconnectedness must arise organically and out of a situation in which the person either comes to a conclusion of their own accord, or perhaps where some subconscious process of the mind is allowed to independently arise in an autonomous manner.\n\nAt this point, I cannot deny that I personally believe the common conception of a separate self is merely a construct of human perception. In fact, I would go even further and state that based upon my extensive research, this widely held position is both philosophically and scientifically justifiable. However, I want to make it clear that I do not have any desire to convince people of that here. Instead, I simply aim to document the subjective experience of this perspective in a manner that is as comprehensive and reasonable as possible. This is with the hope that people far more intelligent than me can someday use this article as a template for furthering our collective understanding of this profound and absolutely fascinating state of mind.','\n',char(10)),'','','https://www.effectindex.com/effects/unity-and-interconnectedness','https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness');

At its lower levels, this results in visual acuity suppression, double-vision, visual agnosia, and frame rate suppression. This experience can create a wide range of subjective changes to a person''s perception of their own vision. These are described and documented in the list below:\n\n* Feeling as if one is watching the world through a screen\n\n* Feeling as if the visually perceivable world is further away in distance\n\n* Feeling as if one is looking at the world through someone else''s eyes\n\n* Double vision that, at higher levels, forces the user to close one eye if they need to read or perceive fine visual details\n\nVisual disconnection is often accompanied by other coinciding effects, such as cognitive disconnection and physical disconnection. This results in the sensation that one is partially or completely detaching from both their sensory input and their conscious faculties. It is a near-universal effect under the influence of moderate dosages of dissociative compounds, such as ketamine, PCP, and DXM.\n\nAt its higher levels, visual disconnection can become all-encompassing in its effects. This results in a complete perceptual disconnection from one''s sense of sight, which can be described as the experience of being completely blinded and unable to tell whether the eyes are open or closed due to a total lack of sensory input. During this state, the effect often leads one into the experience of finding themselves floating through a dark and mostly empty hallucinatory void.\n\nHoles, spaces and voids are a sub-component of visual disconnection that manifest when it has become all-encompassing in its intensity. This experience is more commonly known as a "K-hole"\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\nand is generally discussed as something that is specifically associated with ketamine, despite being present within most traditional dissociatives. A K-hole can be described as the place a person finds themselves in once visual disconnection becomes powerful enough to leave the person incapable of receiving external sensory input, replacing their visual input with a space that subjectively feels as if it is outside of normal reality.\n\nThe visual appearance of this space, hole, or void can be described as a vast, mostly empty and darkened chamber that often feels and appears to be infinite in size. This space is usually dark black in its colour, but can occasionally display itself with large patches of slow-moving amorphous colour clouds or subtle geometric patterns across its horizon. At its higher levels, these voids are often populated with hallucinatory structures, which are comprehensively described and documented in the subsection below.\n\nAlongside this visual experience, changes in gravity and a powerful sense of tactile disconnection are also usually present. This can result in one feeling as if they are undergoing an out-of-body experience while weightlessly floating through a void over great distances in a variety of different speeds, directions, and orientations. This is a feeling that is interpreted by many people as floating through space or the night sky.\n\nStructures are the only feature found within what would otherwise be completely empty and uninhabited voids. These manifest as monolithic 3-dimensional shapes or structures of an infinite variety and size that float above, below, around, or in front of a person as they gradually zoom, rotate, transform, or pan into focus, gradually unveiling before the person''s line of sight.\n\nThese structures can take the form of any shape, but common examples include vast and giant pillars, columns, tunnels, blocks, buildings, slides, monuments, wheels, pyramids, caves, and a variety of abstract shapes. They are often fractal in shape and can manifest in a variety of colours, but usually follow darker themes and tones with an associated aesthetic that is sometimes subjectively interpreted as "alien" in nature.\n\nStructures can be broken down into the 4 basic levels of complexity and visual intensity described below:\n\nStructures typically display themselves anywhere between 30 seconds to several minutes before the person experiencing them slips back into reality or into the presence of another structure. In terms of how these structures shift between each other, their transition processes can be broken down into 4 basic categories. These are described and documented below:\n\n*  - Structures can switch between each other by transforming or shapeshifting in a static and comprehensible way. This is something that usually unfolds in a gradual step-by-step morphing process.\n\n*  - Structures can switch between each other by remaining completely static in their shape and simply panning out of view until they are no longer within one''s field of vision. It’s from here that another structure usually comes into view from outside of one''s peripheral vision within a few seconds to a couple of minutes.\n\n*  - Structures can switch between each other by disassembling into many tiny sections that resemble pixels, or building blocks. This occurs in a manner that is reminiscent of smoke or dust blowing in the wind. When forming through this style, the structure will appear to assemble itself step-by-step, becoming increasingly complex as it occurs.\n\n*  - The third method of transitioning is experienced when the structures appear to be stationary whilst one is floating silently between them over what can feel like extreme physical distances. This floating is sometimes felt to occur on an invisible rail through the vast and infinite dissociative hole."','\n',char(10)),'','','https://www.effectindex.com/effects/visual-disconnection','https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection');

These processes often include concepts such as the structure of one''s neurology, identity, memories, perspectives, emotions, and general cognitive functions.\n\nAs a direct result of this, the organization, structure, and programming behind a person''s conscious mind are felt to be conceptually understood through the perception of these geometric forms. This is generally interpreted by those who undergo it as visually perceiving the supposed inner workings of either "the universe", "consciousness", or "reality".\n\nDuring the experience, some users feel as though the effect is capable of bestowing specific pieces of information onto them regarding the nature of reality and consciousness. These specific pieces of information are usually felt and understood to be a profound unveiling of an undeniable truth at the time. Afterward, however, they are often found to be meaningless, nonsensical, or delusional. Although, genuine lessons or coherent messages can occasionally be taken away from these experiences. It’s extremely important to note that the scientific validity of these lessons is very uncertain and should never be immediately accepted as true without an extremely thorough and sober analysis.\n\nPerceived exposure to inner mechanics of consciousness is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as ego death and high level geometry.

Together, these individual geometric representations are perceived to simultaneously convey every internally stored concept and memory contained within the mind.\n\nAt its lower end, this effect is something that fluctuates wildly and is neither constant or consistent in its intensity. Instead, it is momentarily triggered by the experience of a concept. For example, if someone were to say the word "Internet" to a person who is currently undergoing this state, they would see the mind''s concept of the Internet immediately manifested in a geometric form amidst the very centre of their visual field. This form will then quickly branch out from itself in a manner similar to a spider diagram or mind map chart.\n\nFor example, the concept "Internet" may have dozens of immediate child nodes that are representative of computers, which may have associated descendant nodes involving technologies. This may branch out further to include concepts representing human intelligence, which may then branch out into concepts related to the evolution of humanity, and so on until all concepts known to the person are represented within the network.\n\nOnce this occurs, the sensory overload can temporarily disconnect one from their external environment and result in simultaneous long-term memory suppression, or "ego death",  for several seconds to a minute before a person is briefly returned to reality. This is usually triggered again and again in quick succession. However, it is worth noting that this process can, to a certain extent, be disabled through continuous physical movements. This may be because movement stops the process of thoughts branching out by not giving one''s brain the time it needs to lock onto new concepts as it is focused on movement rather than processing thoughts.\n\nAs the dose of the psychoactive substance is increased, the process becomes easier to trigger while extending its length and duration. This eventually results in a stable state of complete disconnection from the external environment alongside sustained "ego death", as well as feelings of experiencing "all of existence" in a single instant.\n\nVisual exposure to inner mechanics of consciousness is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as ego death and high level geometry.
