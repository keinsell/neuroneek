# Identification

Identification is a library that provides a set of functions to identify a
entity in system.

- Usage of [`ksuid`](https://github.com/segmentio/ksuid) created and maintained
  by [Segment](https://segment.com/) (
  Node.js implementation)
- Usage of namespace identification for presentational purposes,
  eg. `user_asdglksjgfjksgd` instead of `asdglksjgfjksgd`
  which would provide better context to end user of APIs or just better
  understanding of logs.
