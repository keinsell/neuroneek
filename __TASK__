# Implementation of Collective Ingestion Insight

## Overview
Feature to display active substance ingestions with their current phases and amounts, providing a clear overview of all substances currently affecting the user. Ojective is to show user how many of a "subjective" dosage he is feeling right now, with pseudo-adjustement for amount that is coming down or is afterglow to those who are comming in.

## Current System Analysis
- System already tracks individual ingestions with phases (Onset, Comeup, Peak, Comedown, Afterglow)
- Each ingestion has substance name, dosage, and timing information
- Phases are tracked with start/end times and durations
- Active phase detection is already implemented

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Group active ingestions by substance
   - Multiple ingestions of the same substance should be shown together
   - Show total active amount per substance

2. Display Phase Information
   - Show current phase for each active ingestion
   - Include time remaining in current phase
   - Use phase indicators (↑ comeup, → peak, ↓ comedown)

3. Amount Tracking
   - Display individual ingestion amounts
   - Show combined amount for multiple ingestions of same substance

### Example Output Format

Prepare feature to show how much of a substance is at which stage from ingesitons that are active, ex morning coffee is coming down (80mg caffeine) and evening coffee is on comeup (80mg caffeine)
