**Title:** Substance Interaction Warnings

**As a** user concerned about safety, **I want to** be alerted to potential negative interactions between substances I'm logging, **so that** I can avoid harmful combinations and make informed decisions about my usage.

**Scenario:**

[[Mark]] is tracking his use of both a prescription medication and a herbal supplement in Neuronek. When he logs a new ingestion of the supplement, Neuronek displays a warning flag, indicating a potential moderate interaction between the two substances based on their known effects. Mark can then click on the flag to view detailed information about the potential interaction, including severity, symptoms, and recommendations for mitigating risk. This allows Mark to make a more informed decision about whether to proceed with taking the supplement or consult a healthcare professional.
