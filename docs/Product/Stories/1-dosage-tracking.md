As a regular user of psychoactive substances, [[Lisa]] wants to ensure that she is using them in a safe and healthy way, so she downloads the Neuronek app to help her keep track of her usage.

When Lisa opens the app, she selects the "Dosage Tracking" feature and is prompted to input the name and type of the substance she is taking, as well as the dosage and time of day that she is taking it. She is able to choose from a comprehensive database of substances, which includes information about their effects, dosages, and potential risks.

Lisa sets personal goals for her usage of psychoactive substances, such as reducing anxiety and improving her mood. Based on these goals and her usage patterns, Neuronek provides her with personalized dosing recommendations and insights into how different substances are impacting her mental health.

Over time, Lisa is able to track her progress towards her goals and adjust her usage accordingly. She sets reminders for herself to take or not take certain substances, and she receives notifications when her usage patterns indicate a potential risk for addiction or other negative health outcomes.

Thanks to Neuronek, Lisa is able to use psychoactive substances in a safe and healthy way, without experiencing any negative side effects or risks to her mental health. She feels empowered and in control of her usage, and she recommends the app to her friends and family who are also interested in using psychoactive substances for personal benefit.
