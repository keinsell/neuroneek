**Title:** Understanding Substance Impact on Mood

**As a** user seeking to understand the effects of substances on my well-being, **I want to** track my mood and symptoms alongside my substance use, **so that** I can identify patterns and correlations between my usage and how I feel.

**Scenario:**

[[Lisa]] wants to understand how her microdosing of LSD is impacting her anxiety levels. Within Neuronek, she sets up a daily mood tracker, rating her anxiety on a scale of 1 to 10. She also logs specific symptoms she experiences, such as headaches or difficulty sleeping. Over time, Neuronek visualizes her mood and symptom data alongside her LSD usage, allowing her to see potential correlations. She notices that on days she microdoses, her anxiety ratings tend to be lower, but she also experiences more frequent headaches. This information helps Lisa make more informed decisions about her microdosing schedule and whether to adjust her dosage or frequency.
