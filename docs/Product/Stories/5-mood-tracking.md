[[John]] has been using the Neuronek app to track his dosage of psilocybin for a few weeks now. He has noticed some positive changes in his mood and energy levels, but he wants to be able to track his mood more specifically. He decides to use the "Mood Tracking" feature of Neuronek to monitor his emotional state throughout the day.

Using the app, John inputs his current mood, along with any relevant notes about his thoughts, feelings, or environment. Over time, he is able to see patterns in his mood and identify which dosages or substances are most effective for improving his emotional well-being.

The app provides John with insights into how different substances are impacting his mood over time. For example, he notices that he tends to feel more anxious or restless after using caffeine or nicotine, while he feels more calm and focused after taking L-theanine or CBD.

With the help of Neuronek's mood tracking feature, John is able to optimize his dosage and usage of psychoactive substances to promote a positive and stable emotional state.
