As a busy individual who uses psychoactive substances for personal benefit, [[Max]] wants to ensure that he is using them in a safe and consistent way. He downloads Neuronek to help him keep track of his usage and optimize his dosages.

When Max opens the app, he selects the "Dosage Reminders" feature and inputs the name and type of the substance he is taking, as well as the desired dosage and time of day he wants to take it.
