- Stack defines set of multiple [[Ingestion]] that are applied in a specific period of time, let's say some [[Subject]] is drinking coffee every day at 9:00 and he just do not want to open application to entry this every day. Application should allow to define plans and their cycle to avoid "too frequent" need to open the application.

> Speaking personally as a smoker, this is a huge for me because when it comes to every single application for tracking habits I just damn do not want to pick my phone where I going for cigarette and for vaping it's even worse. I know how much I smoke, maybe in different intervals but all of these is editable later.
