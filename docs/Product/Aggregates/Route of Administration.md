The Route of Administration (ROA) is a critical data point in any psychoactive substance tracking application. It refers to the method by which a substance is introduced into the body, such as orally, through injection, or via inhalation. Tracking the ROA is essential for understanding the onset and duration of a substance's effects, as well as its potential for harm and the appropriate dosage.

In Neuronek, the ROA data is structured similarly to other drug information databases such as PsychonautWiki, Tripsit, or DrugBank. Each substance in the database is associated with one or more ROAs, along with relevant information such as the typical onset and duration of effects, recommended dosages for each ROA, and potential risks or side effects associated with each ROA.

- There is a constraint between ROA and [[Substance]], as for every classification of route of administration (ex. Oral) we must enforce no duplication for substance. Like Caffeine cannot have multiple Oral RoAs, there just a only one. Where there may be multiple RoAs of different kind ex. Injections, Insufflations and so on.


The ROA data structure in Neuronek includes several key fields, including:

1. ROA type: This field indicates the method by which the substance is introduced into the body, such as oral, intranasal, intravenous, or inhalation.

2. Onset time: This field indicates the typical time it takes for the substance's effects to begin after the ROA is administered.

3. Duration: This field indicates the length of time that the substance's effects are typically experienced after the ROA is administered.

4. Dosage range: This field indicates the recommended dosage range for the substance when administered via the specified ROA.

5. Potential risks: This field indicates any potential risks or side effects associated with the specified ROA, such as increased risk of addiction, respiratory depression, or overdose.

6. Additional notes: This field provides any additional relevant information about the specified ROA, such as tips for safe usage or advice on how to minimize potential risks.

The ROA data in Neuronek is designed to be comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date, providing users with the information they need to make informed decisions about their substance usage. By tracking the ROA along with other key data points such as dosage and frequency of use, Neuronek provides users with a powerful tool for promoting responsible and safe usage of psychoactive substances.
