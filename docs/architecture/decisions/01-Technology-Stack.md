I've been in a little deep hole recently - in terms of my future on programming with TypeScript with ruined at least two of mine projects because overly lacking safety in back-end development (talking there about fake types) and I'm thinking about experimenting with something else for one project yet I want to get things done after pro-casting this project for kinda very long time - I think it's kinda okay to start this project with TypeScript and then in free time slice it to other language from my list that I want to try.

Database choice for this project is related to choosing the simplest possible database to be implemented, there is no real need to have separate cluster with database for application with no users, so choosing sqlite is actually a great option I think.

As far as it goes, the main focus for now should be delivering API that allows users to authenticate through API and create ingestion, interface will come down later as it can be CLI, Desktop, Mobile or Web - I'm planning to do all of these.

Behind SQLite, I'm starting maintaining Supabase dedicated for this project to keep my ingestions in a similar model as is in application to later import it.
