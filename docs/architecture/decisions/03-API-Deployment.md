Today (28-04-2024)
I come down to deployment of API Service
as my work on front-end application needs a experimental API
to be deployed as I cannot resolve problems with client-side state and localStorage utilizaton,
I've choosen a Railway to deploy my API as I know this will be a few hours of work instead days or weeks comparing to
AWS or Kubernetes, in app will eventually land on these but not today.

I've started to integrate Railway around 12:30 PM
and it's now like 2 PM and we have a working API in a live cloud environment â€” that's awesome!
