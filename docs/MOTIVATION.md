# Motivation of Neuroneek

As 21 y.o guy, I've used quite (quite a lot btw) drugs in my life, and by this road I've made some mistakes that didn't neccesarry come from lack of knowledge but come from lossing track of dosages which resulted in abusement for some preoid of time, in my individual case with BiPolar disorder it's hard to keep a safe distance and it's even harded to survive in my head from time to time. I wish to build something that will help me keep my dosages of psychoactives at track, especially for things that have definitelly too much space in my life (especially Caffeine and Nicotine as two of my most hated and most frustrating addictions)

Additionally I wish to include well-designed knowledge base based on PsychonautWiki (aside integration, information will be manually transcripted and modyfied, just because PsychonautWiki doesn't provide much information about nootropics and supplements).

Time will show what will be going in application, for now it's just dosage tracking application.
