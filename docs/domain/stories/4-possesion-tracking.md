Max, a biohacker who is interested in using nootropics for cognitive enhancement and performance optimization, wants to keep track of his supply of psychoactive substances to ensure that he never runs out of his essential nootropics. He downloads Neuronek and accesses the "Possession Tracking" feature.

Max inputs the name of the substance, the amount he currently possesses, and the date of his last purchase. Based on Max's past usage patterns, Neuronek predicts when he will run out of the substance and alerts him when it's time to reorder.

The Possession Tracking feature also provides Max with information about the average duration of his supply, allowing him to plan his purchases and optimize his usage of the substance in a safe and responsible way.

Thanks to Neuronek's Possession Tracking feature, Max is able to stay on top of his supply of psychoactive substances and never run out of his essential nootropics, ensuring that he can continue to use them for cognitive enhancement in a safe and responsible way.
