### Columns

1. **ID**: Unique identifier for each ingestion
2. **Substance**: Name of the substance
3. **ROA**: Route of administration
4. **Dosage**: Shows both the numerical value and visual classification
   - Format: `"100 mg ●●●○○"`
   - Filled circles (●) indicate dosage level
   - Empty circles (○) indicate remaining levels
   - More filled circles = higher dosage classification
   - Classification is based on substance-specific dosage ranges

5. **Phase**: Shows both the current phase and progress
   - Phase names: Onset, Comeup, Peak, Comedown, Afterglow
   - Progress bar shows total progress through phases:
     ```
     Onset:     ▰▱▱▱▱ (20% through total duration)
     Comeup:    ▰▰▱▱▱ (40% through total duration)
     Peak:      ▰▰▰▱▱ (60% through total duration)
     Comedown:  ▰▰▰▰▱ (80% through total duration)
     Afterglow: ▰▰▰▰▰ (100% through total duration)
     ```
   - Color coding:
     - Onset: Blue
     - Comeup: Green
     - Peak: Red
     - Comedown: Yellow
     - Afterglow: Light gray
     - Unknown/Completed: Dark gray
   - Progress updates in real-time based on ingestion time and phase durations

6. **Time**: Human-readable time since ingestion (e.g., "2 hours ago")
