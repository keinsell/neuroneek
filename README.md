Neuronek is an innovative and valuable application that provides essential tools for people who want to use psychoactive
substances in a safe and healthy way, regardless of their personal goals or usage patterns. The app offers personalized
dosing recommendations, insights into usage patterns, a comprehensive database of substances, and a community of users
who are also interested in promoting responsible usage of these substances.

<h2 align="center">Getting started</h2>

<br>

> [!CAUTION]  
> You should not try to use project at all, front-end is bleeding in terms of functionality and API can be considered read-only with Psychonautwiki substances available - see [Hosted Instance on Railway](https://neuronek.up.railway.app/reference)

```bash
# To be announced 
```

<h2 align="center">Development</h2>

Starting a development in recommended way requires you to have [`nix`](https://nixos.org/),
[`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) and [`devenv`](https://devenv.sh/) installed on your machine,
configuration in repository will automatically spin up all dependencies and set up environment for you ([refer to devenv documentation for setup guide](https://devenv.sh/getting-started/))

```bash
direnv allow
cp example.env .env
devenv shell
pnpm dev
```

<h2 align="center">Technical Approach</h2>

It would be a big waste when I would not learn anything doing such project, in this case I've decided to try Emergent
Design along with Evolutionary architecture and push project through a lot of iterations before releasing final
solution.

<h2 align="center">Documentation</h2>

Documentation is actively maintained
in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/neuronek/invite/3893a7eb16843e642e0155a1119216a84b343d3b), it's public so anyone can
read it and understand vision of project. Besides that, our features, feedback and roadmap is available
at [Hellonext](https://neuronek.hellonext.co/) where everybody is able to add new suggestions to application. There's no
communication channels related to projects and I doubt that they will be created in future. In future feature planning
may happen on [Linear](https://linear.app/neuronek) but as now GitHub issues are good way to go.
