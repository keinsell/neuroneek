# Neuronek

Neuronek is journal that aims to help with cyclic usage of nootropic/adaptogenic drugs.

## Purpose of Application
- As a proud nootropics user I was seeking for something that will save me from my notepad, journaling a lot of ingestions and then calculating things for my own need which obiviously is taking time, I do not want to remember a cycles of specific supplements and I do not want really think when one will start working and will stop working to redose or something. That’s main reason why neuronek will be my best friend.
- I believe a quite big group of people care about their tolerance in recreational drug use so our application will have a point to give users information about their tolerance on specific substances and help them reduce harm in long-term drug usage. We'll also try to help reduce neurotoxicity by notifying users what substances they should avoid in near time based on their journal. Same for functional or nootropics users.
- A lot of people doing drugs, especially in a some kind of raves and parties which can lead to bad (sometimes lethal) situations — our app is here to introduce people who are in touch with drugs (if they do) to reduce harm that they can cause too minimal. That’s optional use-case but may be useful.
