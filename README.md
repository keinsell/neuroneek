# Neuronek

Neuronek is application dedicated for tracking usage of psychoactive substances in favor of harm-reduction, self-improvement and recreational drug usage.

## Why Neuronek?

My life at some point filled with massive amounts of drugs which had it's own consequeneces and in my particular case it was caused mostly by lacking track of my dosages (talking about insane nicotine and caffeine addition). I would like to help other people by providing a little relief of making notes about every possible ingestion to simple in use application which will provide information about ingested substances and will suggest harm-reduction (as well track addition potential) practices to keep healthy relationship with such substances.

## Features of Neuronek

- Keep your ingestions at glance
- **Analisis of active substances in body**, everybody would like to know when one will be tired after ingestion of Caffeine and which subjective effects are produced by substance not really mind itself (for example people can take depressive thoughts as their own after MDMA ingestion over 3 days after ingestion which can bring even more side-effects).
