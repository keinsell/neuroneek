# Neuronek

Neuronek is application dedicated for tracking usage of psychoactive substances in favor of harm-reduction, self-improvement and recreational drug usage.

## Why Neuronek?

My life at some point filled with massive amounts of drugs which had it's own consequeneces and in my particular case it was caused mostly by lacking track of my dosages (talking about insane nicotine and caffeine addition). I would like to help other people by providing a little relief of making notes about every possible ingestion to simple in use application which will provide information about ingested substances and will suggest harm-reduction (as well track addition potential) practices to keep healthy relationship with such substances.
