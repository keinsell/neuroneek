## About

Neuronek is an intelligent dosage tracking application designed to monitor and log the use of supplements, nootropics,
and
psychoactive substances. By recording and analyzing ingestion, it helps users better understand the long-term effects
of these compounds on their physical and mental health.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install the application, please visit the [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/keinsell/neuronek/releases) for
pre-built binaries and installation instructions for your platform. Alternatively, you can install the application from
supported package managers or build it from source.

#### Using a package manager (recommended)

> [!WARNING]
> Application is in early stage of development and to avoid polluting package managers with application that can be
> potentially dead in few months I do recommend installing from source or using available pre-build binaries.
> Application will be available for `homebrew`, `pacman`, `nix`, `scoop`, `dnf` and `apt` when it would be considered
> production-ready.

#### Installation from source (Advanced)

Application can be installed with `cargo` and providing url to this repository,
this may be the most conformable way for users which are looking for the latest version of application.

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/keinsell/neuronek
```

**Note:** This method might be best for users who always want the absolute newest version of the application. However,
it may be less stable than the pre-built binaries.

### Usage

After installation, you can start using the application by running the `psylog` command in your terminal. The
application provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with its features and functionalities.

```bash
‚ùØ neuronek --help
```

## Features

### Ingestions

Ingestions are fundamental area of application, they represent human interaction with chemical compound of choice.
Ingestion explains what compound was ingested, how it was ingested and when it was ingested.

#### [üóé Log Ingestion](https://keinsell.youtrack.cloud/articles/NEU-A-3)

```bash
‚ùØ neuronek ingestion log caffeine 80mg

+----+----------------+--------+----------------------+-------------------------------+
| id | substance_name | route  | dosage               | ingested_at                   |
+----+----------------+--------+----------------------+-------------------------------+
| 1  | caffeine       | "oral" | 80 mg                | 2024-12-16 00:02:48.977457    |
+----+----------------+--------+----------------------+-------------------------------+
```

#### [üóé List Ingestions](https://keinsell.youtrack.cloud/articles/NEU-A-7)

```bash
‚ùØ neuronek ingestion list

+----+----------------+---------------+----------------------+----------------------------+
| id | substance_name | route         | dosage               | ingested_at                |
+----+----------------+---------------+----------------------+----------------------------+
| 36 | caffeine       | "oral"        | 80 mg                | 2024-12-18 08:14:37.211076 |
+----+----------------+---------------+----------------------+----------------------------+
```

#### [üóé Update ingestion](https://keinsell.youtrack.cloud/articles/NEU-A-6)

```bash
‚ùØ neuronek ingestion list

+----+----------------+---------------+----------------------+----------------------------+
| id | substance_name | route         | dosage               | ingested_at                |
+----+----------------+---------------+----------------------+----------------------------+
| 36 | caffeine       | "oral"        | 80  mg               | 2024-12-18 08:14:37.211076 |
+----+----------------+---------------+----------------------+----------------------------+

‚ùØ neuronek ingestion update 36 -d 200mg

+----+----------------+---------------+----------------------+----------------------------+
| id | substance_name | route         | dosage               | ingested_at                |
+----+----------------+---------------+----------------------+----------------------------+
| 36 | caffeine       | "oral"        | 200 mg               | 2024-12-18 08:14:37.211076 |
+----+----------------+---------------+----------------------+----------------------------+
```

#### [üóé Delete Ingestion](https://keinsell.youtrack.cloud/articles/NEU-A-4)

> [!CAUTION]
> Deletion cannot be undone, so verify the correct ID before deleting.

```bash
‚ùØ neuronek ingestion list
 
+----+----------------+--------+----------+----------------------------+
| id | substance_name | route  | dosage   | ingested_at                |
+----+----------------+--------+----------+----------------------------+
| 36 | caffeine       | "oral" | 80 mg    | 2024-12-18 08:14:37.211076 |
+----+----------------+--------+----------+----------------------------+

‚ùØ neuronek ingestion delete 36
```

### Substances

Application comes with pre-bundled database of psychoactive substances built on top
of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org), such information are easily queryable through CLI and are foundation
for further analysis of user's ingestions to provide insight on harm-reduction and predicting subjective effects.

#### Find Substance

TODO: Feature should use humanized search index which will allow for typos and words with same meaning (common names).

#### Get Substance

TODO: Show all information about substance in way ingest-able for end-user which should be able to learn dosages, routes
of administration and maybe overall description of substance.

### FUTURE: Journal

Journal is a feature which aims to compose *ingestion-related* and *substance-related* features of application into
friendly human interface.

- Usecase: Logging ingestions of capsules and pills which may contain multiple substances.
- Usecase: Ingestion planning when it's possible - users should be informed how long it takes for substance to get into
  body and how long it will last.

## Futher Development

*Roadmap is a subject to change and one that is presented here is a high-level overview of direction of the project.*

neuronek is an ongoing project with many planned features and improvements. Some of the key areas of development
include:

- **Journaling**: A user-friendly interface for creating and managing journal entries related to ingestions, thoughts,
  and experiences.
- **Terminal User Interface**: Friendly and efficient interactive interface for terminal application.
- **Web Application**
- **Desktop/Mobile Application**
- **Cloud Sync**
