		"text": "An abnormal heartbeat (also called an arrhythmia or dysrhythmia) is any of a group of conditions in which the electrical activity of the heart is irregular. During this state, the heartbeat may be too fast (over 100 beats per minute) or too slow (less than 60 beats per minute) and may be regular or irregular. A heartbeat that is too fast is called tachycardia and a heartbeat that is too slow is called bradycardia. Although many arrhythmias are not life-threatening, it is worth noting that some can cause cardiac arrest in extreme cases.\n\nAn abnormal heartbeat is most commonly induced under the influence of moderate dosages of stimulant and depressant compounds, such as cocaine, methamphetamine, and GABAergics. While stimulants tend to increase a person's heart rate, depressants tend to decrease it. Combining the two can often result in dangerously irregular heartbeats. However, this effect can also occur under the influence of deliriants."

Fragmentary blackouts, sometimes known as \"brownouts\", are characterized by having the ability to recall specific events from an intoxicated period but remaining unaware that certain memories are missing until reminded of the existence of those gaps in memory. Studies suggest that fragmentary blackouts are far more common than \"en bloc\" blackouts.\n\n[4]\n\nIn comparison, En bloc blackouts are characterized by a complete inability to later recall any memories from an intoxicated period, even when prompted. It is usually difficult to determine the point at which this type of blackout has ended as sleep typically occurs before this happens.\n\n[5]\n\nAmnesia is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as disinhibition, sedation, and memory suppression. It is most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of GABAergic depressants, such as alcohol\n\n[6]\n\n, benzodiazepines\n\n[7]\n\n, GHB\n\n[8]\n\n, and zolpidem\n\n[9]\n\n. However, it can also occur to a much lesser extent under the influence of extremely heavy dosages of hallucinogenic compounds such as psychedelics, dissociatives, Salvia divinorum, and deliriants."

These two states often overlap, but they also differ in that fear is more often associated with surges of autonomic arousal necessary for fight or flight, thoughts of immediate danger, and escape behaviours, while anxiety is more often associated with muscle tension and vigilance in preparation for future danger and cautious or avoidant behaviours.\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\nThis focus of anticipated danger may be internally or externally derived.\n\n[1]\n\nPsychoactive substance-induced anxiety can be caused as an inescapable effect of the drug itself,\n\n[2]\n\nby a lack of experience with the substance or its intensity, as an enhancement of a pre-existing state of mind, or by the experience of negative hallucinations.\n\nAnxiety is often accompanied by other coinciding effects, such as depression and irritability. It is most commonly induced under the influence of moderate dosages of hallucinogenic compounds, such as cannabinoids\n\n[4]\n\n, psychedelics\n\n[5]\n\n, dissociatives, and deliriants\n\n[6]\n\n.

The type of faulty perception experienced during this state can vary. For example, one may interpret noises as intricate voices, elaborately detailed music, or other (unrelated) everyday sounds.\n\nExperiences of auditory misinterpretation are typically sudden and brief in duration. As a result, it is common for people to internally reflect upon the event after recognizing the unusual nature of what they heard and quickly recognize that misinterpretation has taken place. In such a situation, once the sound has been consciously identified as being initially misinterpreted, the effect immediately ceases, sometimes happening quickly enough for the sound to be correctly resolved while it is being heard.\n\nIt is worth noting that while auditory misinterpretation often arises as an isolated effect component, it can also arise as the result of the combination of other coinciding effects, such as auditory hallucinations, auditory distortions, delirium, and confusion. It is most commonly induced under the influence of moderate dosages of deliriant compounds, such as DPH, datura, and benzydamine.

		"text": "An autonomous entity is the experience of perceived contact with hallucinated beings that appear to be sentient and autonomous in their behaviour.\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\n[4]\n\n[5]\n\n[6]\n\n[7]\n\n[8]\n\n[9]\n\nThese entities can manifest within both external and internal hallucinations.\n\n[8]\n\nAutonomous entities will frequently act as the inhabitants of a perceived independent reality.\n\n[7]\n\nThey most commonly appear alone but can also often be within small or large groups alongside of other entities. While some entities do not seem to be aware of a person's presence, others are often precognizant of a person's appearance into their realm and usually choose to interact with them in various ways. For example, they will often display behaviours such as showing a person around the realm that they inhabit, presenting them with objects, holding spontaneous celebrations of their arrival, engaging them in conversation, merging into and out of the person's body or consciousness, and attempting to impart knowledge of various kinds.\n\nEntities can take any form, but certain archetypes are present and commonly include:\n\nHumans,\n\n[4]\n\n[9]\n\nshadow people, bodiless super intelligent humanoids, aliens,\n\n[4]\n\n[9]\n\nelves,\n\n[4]\n\nanimals,\n\n[4]\n\n[9]\n\ngiant spheres, insectoids,\n\n[4]\n\n[9]\n\nbeings of light, anthropomorphic beings,\n\n[4]\n\n[9]\n\nplants,\n\n[4]\n\n[9]\n\nconscious inanimate objects, fictional characters, cartoons, robotic machines, gods,\n\n[4]\n\ndemigods, goddesses, bio-mechanical intelligences, hooded figures, demons, indescribable monstrosities, spirits,\n\n[4]\n\nangels,\n\n[4]\n\nshamans, ghosts, souls, ancestors, fantastical or mythological beasts, glitch creatures, and more.\n\nThe appearance, personality, and behaviour of an autonomous entity often correlates with the psychological state of the person experiencing it. For example, a person with a positive mindset will more commonly experience loving, kind, and healing entities. In contrast, a person with a negative mindset may experience hateful, sinister, and mocking entities.\n\nIn terms of their overall visibility and clarity, this effect is capable of manifesting itself across the 3 different levels of intensity described below:\n\nThe experience of seeing autonomous entities is also often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as geometry,\n\n[5]\n\ninternal hallucinations, and delusions. It is most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogenic compounds, such as psychedelics, dissociatives, and deliriants. However, it can also occur under the influence of stimulant psychosis, with extreme sleep deprivation, or during dreams.\n\nAutonomous entities can communicate with a person via a combination of spoken word, “telepathy”, conceptual thoughts, choreographed movements, mathematics, and geometry-based visual linguistics that generally consist of morphing coloured structures of different textures that are innately understandable as representations of specific concepts. They will often convey insights regarding overcoming personal issues within a person’s life and will occasionally help clarify philosophical or spiritual ideas. However, more often than not, entities are very likely to speak in a cryptic or nonsensical manner that seems to have no clear meaning behind it.\n\nIt is important to note that autonomous entities can never convey novel information to the person experiencing them. For example, they cannot provide insights about the external world that a person did not already know on some level. Instead, they can only provide alternative perspectives and help build upon existing ideas. This is presumably because autonomous entities do not have access to any knowledge not already contained within one's conscious or subconscious memories.\n\nWhen communicated with through spoken word, the level of coherency in which these entities can communicate with is highly variable but can be broken down into five distinct levels. These are described and listed below:\n\nAutonomous entities will often embody at least one of a few approximate personality types. Although there is considerable overlap between them, these personality types can typically be identified primarily through their behaviour, their appearance, and an innate sense of their character that is often felt during the interaction.\n\nThe individual types are broken down and described within the four separate categories listed below:\n\nThis personality type can be described as a seemingly sentient representation of any hallucinatory character that the brain has either spontaneously generated during the trip or was already aware of at a prior time. These entities can include newly hallucinated characters of any sort, people that the person has met in real life, people that the person is aware of as existing in the real world, or characters from fictional media. These entities will usually adopt an appropriate personality and set of mannerisms to fit the chosen concept with an impressive degree of detail. An example of this might be meeting an insectoid mantis like creature that is playing the role of a shamanic teacher and acting accordingly. Another might include meeting the hallucination of a deceased loved one or a currently living family friend.\n\nThis personality type can be described as a seemingly sentient representation of any known concept or idea. These specific concepts could include personified representations of abstract ideas, events, and emotions. An example of this might be meeting a mocking jester that feels and acts as if it represents one's own insecurities. Another might include meeting a group of hooded figures that feel as if they represent the very concept of organized religion itself.\n\nThis personality type can be described as an entity that may take any visible form, but is also subjectively perceived to be an autonomous controller behind the continuous generation of the details of the person’s current hallucinations. They may also be felt to simultaneously control or manage one’s current perspective, personality, and internally stored model of reality. When interacted with, this category of entity can often possess abilities that allow them to directly alter and manipulate one’s current experiences. They commonly want to teach or guide the person and will operate under the assumption that they know what is best for them. However, although a relatively common experience, it still cannot be known whether this type of autonomous entity is genuinely a representation of the \"subconscious\" or is merely an approximation that behaves in a convincing manner.\n\nThis personality type can be described as a direct copy of one’s own personality. It can take any visible form, but when conversed with, it clearly adopts an identical vocabulary and set of mannerisms to one’s own consciousness. This entity will often take on a similar appearance to oneself, but could theoretically take on any other appearance too. During this experience, there is also a distinct feeling that one's own consciousness is somehow being mirrored and duplicated into the hallucinated autonomous entity that is being interacted with."

Higher levels may also manifest itself in multiple voices or even an ambiguous collection of voices such as a crowd.\n\n[3]\n\nHowever, there are some subtle but identifiable differences between this experience and that of normal everyday conversations. These stem from the fact that one's specific set of knowledge, memories and experiences are identical to that of the voice which is being communicated with.\n\n[3]\n\n[5]\n\nThis results in conversations in which both participants often share an identical vocabulary down to the very use of their colloquial slang and subtle mannerisms. As a result of this, no matter how in-depth and detailed the discussion becomes, no entirely new information is ever exchanged between the two communicators. Instead, the discussion focuses primarily on building upon old ideas and discussing new opinions or perspectives regarding the previously established content of one's life.\n\nAutonomous voice communication is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as delusions, autonomous entities, auditory hallucinations, and psychosis in a manner which can sometimes lead the person into believing the voices' statements unquestionably in a delusional manner. It is most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogenic compounds such as psychedelics, dissociatives, and deliriants. However, it may also occur during the offset of prolonged stimulant binges and less consistently under the influence of heavy dosages of cannabinoids."

The pain itself can range from mild and ignorable to intense and distinctly uncomfortable.\n\nWithin the context of psychoactive substances, this effect can occur through tactile enhancement which increases the symptoms of a pre-existing condition which is usually otherwise not noticeable, as a result of muscle tension, as a result of kidney problems, and also as a symptom of withdrawal symptoms from substances which are used for pain relief such as opioids.\n\nBack pain is most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of stimulating psychedelics compounds, such as LSD, 2C-B, and mescaline."

A bronchodilator is a substance that dilates the bronchial tubes resulting in decreased resistance in the respiratory airway and increased airflow to the lungs. From a subjective standpoint, this effect makes it feel as if has become significantly easier and more comfortable to breathe.\n\nBronchodilation is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as stimulation. It is most commonly induced under the influence of moderate dosages of stimulant compounds, such as amphetamine,\n\n[1]\n\nmethamphetamine, and cocaine,\n\n[2]\n\n. These compounds were historically used often for treating asthma but are now rarely if ever, used medically for their bronchodilation effect."

These are described and documented in the list below:\n\n*  Feeling as though one's conscious thought stream and memories are not one's own\n\n*  Feeling as if one's conscious thought processes are distant and vague\n\n*  Feeling as if one's conscious thought processes have become autonomous and mechanical in their structure or behaviour\n\n*  Feeling a decrease in the overall speed, connectivity, and analytical abilities of one's cognitive abilities\n\nCognitive disconnection is often accompanied by other coinciding effects, such as visual disconnection and physical disconnection.

This effect is particularly strong and likely to occur if the objects original colour was bright or out of place.\n\nColour shifting is often accompanied by other coinciding effects, such as colour enhancement and colour replacement. It is most commonly induced under the influence of moderate dosages of psychedelic compounds, such as LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline. However, it can also occur to a lesser extent under the influence of certain stimulants such as MDMA."

This alteration predisposes a user to have thoughts that are no longer primarily comprised of words and linear sentence structures. Instead, thoughts become equally comprised of what is perceived to be extremely detailed renditions of the innately understandable and internally stored concepts that words exist to label. Essentially, thoughts cease to be spoken by an internal narrator and are instead “felt” and intuitively understood.\n\nFor example, if a person were to think of an idea, such as a chair, during this state, one would not hear the word as part of an internal thought stream, but would feel the internally stored, non-linguistic, and innately understandable data that comprises the specific concept labelled within one's memory as a chair. These conceptual thoughts are felt in a comprehensive level of detail that feels as if it is unparalleled within the primarily linguistic thought structure of everyday life. This is sometimes interpreted by those who undergo it as a sort of \"higher level of understanding\".\n\nDuring this experience, conceptual thinking can cause one to feel not just the entirety of a concept's attributed data, but also how a given concept relates to and depends upon other known concepts. This can result in the perception that the person can better comprehend the complex interplay between the idea that is being contemplated and how it relates to other ideas.\n\nConceptual thinking is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as personal bias suppression and analysis enhancement. It is most commonly induced under the influence of moderate dosages of hallucinogenic compounds, such as psychedelics and dissociatives. However, it can also occur to a lesser extent under the influence of entactogens, cannabinoids, and meditation."

The average healthy human heart normally beats 60 to 100 times a minute when a person is at rest. When the heart rate fluctuates to lower levels under 60 BPM, it is described as bradycardia or an abnormally low heart rate.\n\nIt is worth noting that decreased heart rate can often be a result of psychological symptoms as a natural response to relaxation, anxiety suppression, sedation, and mindfulness.\n\nDecreased heart rate is most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of depressant compounds, such as GABAergics, and opioids. However, it can also occur under the influence of cannabinoids, dissociatives, and stimulants."

		"text": "Dehydration can be described as an uncomfortably dry mouth and feelings of general thirstiness that results due to a lack of water intake. Untreated dehydration generally results in delirium, unconsciousness, swelling of the tongue, and (in extreme cases) death. The formal definition of dehydration is defined as an excessive loss of body water within a living organism which results in an accompanying disruption of metabolic processes.\n\nAt lower levels, substance-induced dehydration can be generally described as a sense of consistent and uncomfortable thirst which necessitates sipping at a drink to maintain fluid levels and to avoid an uncomfortably dry mouth. At extreme levels (which generally only occur through the use of deliriants), the dehydration can become so powerful that the person may find themselves with painfully dry eyes and mucous membranes in a manner which results in extreme difficulty swallowing.\n\nDehydration is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as dry mouth, headaches, dizziness, decreased blood pressure, and fainting when standing up. It is most commonly induced under the influence of moderate dosages of a wide variety of compounds such as, stimulants, psychedelics, opioids, dissociatives, deliriants, cannabinoids, alcohol, and antipsychotics.\n\nIt's important to note that regardless of how dehydrated a person may become under the influence of any substance, careful effort and consideration should always be put into ensuring that they do not drink water excessively as it can result in a state known as water intoxication. This can be potentially fatal and is classed as a disturbance in brain functions that results when the normal balance of electrolytes in the body is pushed outside of safe limits by over-hydration. Although extremely rare, there have been a few notable deaths which were clearly triggered by the excessive overconsumption of water under the influence of drug-induced dehydration.\n\nThe average toxic dosage of water in a human being is roughly ten litres. However, water intoxication can be easily avoided by simply being aware of it and taking care to sip at water while avoiding the consumption of unnecessarily large amounts."

The perceptual disturbances accompanying delirium include misinterpretations, illusions, or hallucinations; these disturbances are typically visual but may occur in other modalities as well, and range from simple and uniform to highly complex.

		"text": "A delusion is a false idea or belief that is held with strong conviction and subjective certainty and is inconsistent with an individual’s educational, cultural and social background. Delusions are not usually amenable to logic and are often immediately recognizable as false and absurd to others.\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\nDelusions are most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogenic compounds, such as psychedelics, deliriants, and dissociatives. However, they can also occur to a lesser extent under the influence of cannabinoids, stimulant psychosis, and sleep deprivation.\n\nThis article focuses primarily on the types of delusion that are commonly induced with hallucinogens and other psychoactive substances. It therefore is not an exhaustive examination of all delusions listed within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) that are known to occur to people who suffer from chronic psychological conditions, such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.\n\nWhen associated with psychoactive substance use, delusions tend to occur during the peak of a substance’s effect, though they may also occur as a result of withdrawal from substances such as benzodiazepines. In contrast to disease-based delusions, substance-induced delusions are often ‘broken-out of’ after the duration of the substance’s effect, or when they are provided enough evidence to contradict their delusion. It is rare for a delusion to persist after the effects of a substance have waned.\n\nIt is difficult to clearly define the boundary between ‘normal’ beliefs and the delusions that occur while on psychoactive substances. In the context of psychoactive substance use, there is a discernible continuum between beliefs held while sober and the fully delusional beliefs held by those experiencing psychosis. Beliefs that are overvalued yet not delusional are commonly encountered at moderate substance intensity levels. Overvalued beliefs are those which are held with unusual fervency, but are not clearly absurd, such as the paranoid conviction that one’s friends are going to call emergency services imminently. With an increase in substance intensity overvalued beliefs can potentially develop into delusions proper.\n\nA common component to delusions and overvalued beliefs is a markedly increased sense of conviction in one’s beliefs. The intensity of this conviction roughly corresponds to the intensity of the substance’s effect. When conviction is increased, intuitive thinking is likewise increased, resulting in abnormally bold (and often tenuous) ideas and claims about science, metaphysics, politics, art and religion.\n\nAlthough substance-induced delusions can occur in myriad forms, they can be often categorized as belonging to particular types, the most common of which are documented and described below:\n\nGrandiose delusions are those where there is an inflated sense of personal accomplishment or status, possibly as a product of effects experienced while under the influence of psychedelics or stimulants, including ego-inflation, mania, geometry and internal hallucinations. These delusions persist for the duration of the substance’s effect, but will often be recognized as absurd upon obtaining sobriety.\n\nThe idea that one has ‘transcended to a higher level of being’ and is destined to solve the multitude of the world’s problems using extra-dimensional knowledge.\n\nThe idea that one has obtained an enlightened or god-like status comparable to The Buddha or Jesus and now comprehends the simple answer to life, the universe and everything. This individual may make claims that they have obtained a permanent enlightened status, eliminated their ego, and shall become historically noteworthy. This delusion is more common amongst users of short-acting ego death inducing hallucinogenic substances, such as DMT, nitrous oxide and salvia.\n\nThe idea that one has figured out, due to their supreme genius, the mathematical, scientific, and philosophical problems that no one before them could.\n\nThe idea that one has obtained an (often supernatural) ability that few others have. This may include abilities such as telepathy, levitation or willing the universe into producing particular outcomes.\n\nThe idea that one knows or can determine events that are bound to occur in the future. These predicted events can range from the mundane (‘My friend is going to call me.’) to the calamitous (‘Russia is about to invade the United States.’)\n\nWhile these delusions are most often applied to the individual who is undergoing the effects of the substance, they may also be applied to others, such as believing a close friend is in some way extraordinary. This projection may be influenced by a disparity in psychological states, such as that between those who are sober and those under the influence of a psychoactive substance.\n\nParanoid Delusions are delusions where there is a tremendous sense of fear and conviction that one is being watched, monitored, spied upon, and/or plotted against despite there being no evidence to substantiate such a claim.\n\nParanoid delusions are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of psychedelic compounds. However, they can also occur during extreme sleep deprivation and stimulant psychosis.\n\nSomatic Delusions are delusions that involve the belief that the body, or part of it, is missing, broken, deformed, diseased or dysfunctional. These beliefs are typically bizarre and are distinguished from tactile hallucination by seeming so real to the individual experiencing them as to cause significant emotional distress.\n\n*  The belief that one’s intestines are decomposing.\n\n*  That the tension in one’s throat is the result of the vocal cords becoming knotted.\n\n*  That there is a parasitic worm crawling around in one’s stomach.\n\n*  That a limb is dead, dying or missing.\n\nDelusions of Reference (also referred to as ideas of reference) are one of the most common types of delusion. This delusion typically involves the falsely held belief that an insignificant remark, event, coincidence, or object in the person's environment is either a reaction to the individual or has significant personal meaning relating directly back to their life.\n\n[6]\n\n[7]\n\n[8]\n\nIn psychiatry, delusions of reference form part of the diagnostic criteria for illnesses such as schizophrenia, delusional disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizotypal personality disorder. To a lesser extent, they can also be a symptom of paranoid personality disorder. However, delusions of reference are especially common under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogens or during stimulant psychosis.\n\nA list of common examples of this type of delusion are described and documented below:\n\n*  Believing that people in a passing car are talking about you.\n\n*  Believing that people on television or in other forms of media are talking about or directly to you.\n\n*  Believing that headlines and news articles are written specifically for or about you.\n\n*  Believing that events (even world events) have been deliberately planned for you, or have special personal significance for you.\n\n*  Believing that the lyrics of a song are specifically about or for you.\n\n*  Believing that electronic devices are sending you secret and significant messages that only you are capable of understanding.\n\n*  Believing that objects, situations, and events are being deliberately organized to convey a special or particular meaning to you.\n\n*  Believing that the slightest  bodily movement of another person has a significant and deliberate meaning.\n\n*  Believing that posts on social media have hidden meanings pertaining to you.\n\nDelusions of Death & Dying are distressing, falsely-held beliefs that one is about to die, is currently dying, no longer exists, or has already died. This delusion may be a result of a diminished sense of self or identity that usually occurs during states of high-level ego death.\n\nThese delusions are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy doses of psychedelics and to a lesser extent dissociatives.\n\nDelusions of Guilt are caused by unfounded and intense feelings of remorse or guilt that lead the person to conclude that one must have committed some sort of deeply unethical act. The supposed unethical act can range from something relatively mild, such as the belief that the person has cheated on their partner; it can also be something much more serious, such as the belief that they have murdered their friends and family.\n\nDelusions of guilt are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of psychedelic and dissociative compounds.\n\nDelusions of reified fiction are the unfounded belief that something fictional, such as the plot of a TV show, film, video game, or book, is an actual real-life event. This delusion may manifest as the perception that the fictional events within media that is currently being consumed are genuinely occurring in one's immediate vicinity, or simply that the events in the media are real and currently occurring somewhere in the world. This delusion seems to be a result of high-level immersion enhancement combined with memory suppression creating a state of mind in which somebody is highly engrossed in media while no longer having a functional long-term memory that can recall the difference between reality and fiction.\n\nDelusions of reified fiction are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of dissociative and occasionally psychedelic compounds.\n\nis the unfounded belief that the person is currently inside of a video game, dream, or movie and therefore their current actions will not have any real-life consequences. In extreme situations and depending on the person, this delusion can sometimes result in committing crimes or violent acts. It seems to be a result of intense psychosis, derealization, disinhibition and memory suppression combining to create an altered state of mind in which somebody mistakes reality for a fictional hallucination.\n\nDelusional derealization is most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogens and occasionally during stimulant psychosis.\n\nA delusion of sobriety typically involves the falsely held belief that one is perfectly sober despite obvious evidence to the contrary, such as severe cognitive impairment, significant motor control loss, and an inability to fully communicate with others.\n\nDelusions of sobriety are most commonly experienced under the influence of GABAergic compounds such as alcohol and benzodiazepines. However, in many cases, this state of mind can stem not just from the delusional belief of one's own sobriety, but also from a sense of denial that is motivated by a need to protect one's ego, or a genuine inability to identify one's own intoxication.\n\nA delusion of permanent unsobriety is the belief that has permanently changed the operation of their mind and will remain in an unsober state. This can also manifest as a fear that one has broken their brain through substance abuse, despite there being no convincing evidence to substantiate such a claim.\n\nDelusions of permanent unsobriety are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of dissociative and occasionally psychedelic compounds.\n\nShared delusions are when a delusional belief is experienced in a group setting and it begins to spread between individuals who are similarly intoxicated.\n\n[4]\n\nFor example, if one person makes a verbal statement regarding a delusional belief that they are currently holding while in the presence of other similarly intoxicated people, they may also begin to hold the same delusion. This can result in shared hallucinations and a general reinforcement of the level of conviction in which they are each holding the delusional belief.\n\nShared delusions are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of psychedelic compounds.\n\nDelusional parasitosis, also known as Ekbom's syndrome,\n\n[13]\n\n[14]\n\nis a form of delusion in which victims acquire a strongly held belief that they are infested with parasites, bugs, and insects, whereas in reality, no such parasites are present.\n\n[15]\n\nSufferers may injure themselves in attempts to rid themselves of the \"parasites.\" Some are able to induce the condition in others through suggestion, in which case the term \"folie à deux\" may be applicable.\n\n[14]\n\n[16]\n\nDuring this state, nearly any marking upon the skin, small object or particle found on the person or their clothing can be interpreted as evidence for the parasitic infestation. If this delusion is ongoing, sufferers may compulsively gather such \"evidence\" and then present it to medical professionals when seeking help.\n\n[17]\n\nIn the context of psychoactive substances this effect is common during stimulant psychosis, often after chronic usage of cocaine or methamphetamine.\n\n[18]"

		"text": "Depersonalization is an effect that I have experienced during almost every waking second of my adult life. It started as a young teenager when I began to realise that I no longer felt as if I was myself or that I even had a sense of self, alongside the sensation that my entire body and consciousness was in a state of mechanical autopilot. However, at the age of 17, my feelings of depersonalisation were spontaneously eradicated during a single LSD trip. This experience returned my sense of selfhood and gave me the profound sensation that I was not an electrochemical machine responding to external sensory input with fully pre-programmed responses. Instead, I realised that I was, in fact, a conscious agent living in an external world and completely capable of making my own choices through the application of free will, a state of mind which I have come to realise most people take entirely for granted.\n\nAlthough this feeling of \"normalcy\" lasted the better part of 3 years, it eventually began to fade back into depersonalisation. It's been 6 years now and I have not experienced that sense of selfhood or free will since I was a teenager. I've given up hope that I ever will again. However, it's important to note that despite this persistent and continuous depersonalisation, my ability to function and live a happy life remains completely unaffected. This has left me with the impression that those who experience fear or disorientation when undergoing this state are not experiencing feelings that are intrinsic to the condition itself, but are instead responding to a forced change in their culturally embedded assumptions on the nature of human identity."

		"text": "Depression medically encompasses a large variety of different mood disorders whose common features are a sad, empty, or irritable mood co-occurring with bodily and cognitive changes that significantly disrupt an individual's ability to function.\n\n[1]\n\nThese different mood disorders have different durations, timing, or presumed origin. However, differentiating normal sadness/grief from a depressive episode requires a careful and meticulous examination. For example: the death of a loved one may cause great suffering, but it does not typically produce a medically defined depressive episode.\n\n[1]\n\nWithin the context of psychoactive substance usage, depressivity is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as anxiety, irritability and dysphoria. It is most commonly induced through prolonged chronic stimulant or depressant use, during the withdrawal symptoms of almost any substance, or during the comedown/crash of a stimulant. It is associated specifically with higher alcohol consumption.\n\n[4]\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that substance-induced depressivity is often much shorter lasting than clinical depression, usually subsiding once the effects or withdrawal symptoms of a drug have ended.\n\nIf you suspect that you are experiencing symptoms of depression, it is highly recommended to seek out therapeutic medical attention and/or a support group. Additionally, you may want to read our depression reduction effect and Psychedelic Therapy review.\n\nIt is worth noting that depression as an effect has an unfortunately non-specific definition. It is due to this that there are a number of other relevant terms which should be taken into account when trying to understand this state of mind. These are listed and described below:\n\nDepressivity is medically recognized as feelings of being intensely sad, miserable, and/or hopeless. Some patients describe an absence of feelings and/or dysphoria; difficulty recovering from such moods; pessimism about the future; pervasive shame and/or guilt; feelings of inferior self-worth; and thoughts of suicide and suicidal behavior.Depressive symptoms may include fatigue, lack of ability to concentrate, or significant changes in weight or sleep.\n\nMajor Depressive Disorder (MDD) is medically recognized as discrete episodes of depressivity lasting at least two weeks (although most episodes last considerably longer).\n\n[1]\n\nThis is the traditional characterization for the term medical term depression.\n\nDysthymia is medically recognized as a chronic major depressive disorder and is typically diagnosed after two years of continued mood disturbance.\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\nAcute depressivity (colloquially referred to as \"feeling depressed\"), when indicated by either self-report or observation made by others, encompasses the following symptoms:\n\n*  Feeling intensely sad, miserable, and/or hopeless along with pessimism about the future.\n\n*  Anhedonia: a markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.\n\n*  Inability to sleep or sleeping too much.\n\n*  Feelings worthless or excessive/inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional)\n\n*  Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying).\n\n*  Recurrent suicidal ideation: without a specific plan, having a plan, or a suicide attempt.\n\nFor a diagnosis of major depressive disorder to be accurate, the symptoms must cause readily observable distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning for an extended period of time. The episode must not be better explained by a different mood disorder. The symptoms also cannot be attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the studies referenced here will refer to Depression as it is traditionally defined in medical and scientific literature AKA Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).\n\nMajor depression affects 5-20% of the population at some point in their life.\n\n[3]\n\nIt results from the combination of genetics and environments with a heritability of greater than 30%. Common environmental influences (parenting style, socioeconomic status, or local environmental qualities) are quite small; however this does not mean these influences are irrelevant. What seems to matter is how a specific individual interacts with their environment across developmental stages.\n\n[5]\n\nStressful life events are significantly associated with depression.\n\n[6]\n\nDepression is a life-threatening disorder. Both depression and subclinical depression increase all-cause mortality similarly;\n\n[7]\n\n[8]\n\nhowever subclinical depression does not have an exact definition yet (making it harder to study). The impact depression has on quality of life is comparable or greater than other chronic medical illnesses.\n\n[3]\n\nCognitive impairment is a core feature of depression that remains after remission and cannot be considered a result of low mood.\n\n[9]\n\n[10]\n\nAlthough there is some evidence associating depressivity and functionality, depression severity accounts for -at most- 10% of the variability in cognitive dysfunction. Both age of onset and depression severity also modify this effect’s magnitude and what cognitive deficits arise.\n\n[11]\n\nAs a generality (not developed in parallel), more severe depression correlates with significant decreases in cognitive performance.\n\n[9]\n\n[11]\n\nThese cognitive deficits are significantly associated with poor psychosocial functioning (psychological factors combined with the surrounding social environment).\n\nPsychosocial impairment is also a core feature of depression that remains after remission. Psychosocial stressors are associated with the onset, severity, and progression of MDD.\n\n[12]\n\nMore severe depression can be considered a disability, or disorder, of psychosocial function.\n\n[3]\n\nEven brief psychosocial interventions in the form of collaborative care (e.g. a telephone call reminding to take medication) may be comparably effective to more intensive forms of face-to-face psychotherapy.\n\n[13]\n\nImproving cognitive deficits may also improve psychosocial functioning. Although impaired attention and executive functions remain in patients whose depressive symptoms alleviate, memory functions may improve to only a small deficit.\n\n[9]\n\nImprovements in mood are most closely related to improvements in verbal memory, verbal fluency, and psychomotor speed.\n\nDepression is accompanied by immune system dysregulation and activation of the body’s inflammatory response system.\n\n[3]\n\n[7]\n\n[14]\n\nSpecific biomarkers have small but significantly higher concentrations associated with the incidence and severity of depression.\n\nIt is difficult to say how biological sex interacts due to increasing the number of females in a sample causing the relationship between depression and inflammation to become nonsignificant.\n\n[7]\n\nEstrogen interacts with CRP and IL6, thus fluctuations in menstrual cycles and hormonal contraceptives may affect these results. Yet, overall the fundamental genetic architecture appears the same across samples and genders.\n\n[5]\n\nThese proinflammatory small protein messengers, called cytokines, increase indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression in both central and peripheral immune-competent cells. IDO increases the synthesis of kynurenine from dietary tryptophan, so this may cause a decrease in tryptophan availability. Tryptophan is required to synthesize serotonin and melatonin.\n\n[3]\n\nAdditionally, there is no evidence the serotonin transporter genotype alone or in interaction with stressful life events is associated with an elevated risk of depression.\n\n[6]\n\nKynurenine also produces endogenous NMDA agonist metabolites that could disrupt neurotransmission along glutaminergic pathways and lead to excitotoxicity in the form of hippocampal neuron damage/death.\n\n[3]\n\nWithin the central nervous system, proinflammatory cytokines play important roles in the body’s stress response system and within the regulation of neurogenesis.\n\n[3]\n\nStress response is mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.The HPA axis allows organisms to adapt to physical and psychosocial changes in their environments. There is a substantial link between MDD and HPA abnormalities and it is well established that approximately half of depressed patients have HPA axis hyperactivity."

		"text": "Depression reduction is the experience of minimizing the symptoms associated with depression and low mood states. It is distinct from effects such as cognitive euphoria, as it does not simply elevate the user's mood but instead results in a sense of stable emotional well-being.\n\nDepression reduction most commonly occurs with adequate nutritional intake.\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\n[4]\n\n[5]\n\nSevere depression is effectively reduced with conventional antidepressants; although in mild to moderate depression, SSRI's and tricyclic antidepressants appear (on average) to be either only minimally helpful or completely ineffective.\n\n[6]\n\nHowever, depression reduction can also occur under the influence of hormone replacement therapies\n\n[7]\n\nand modafinil.\n\n[8]\n\nEuthymia (semantically the opposite of dysthymia) is a long-lasting and self‐sustaining experience of stable emotional well-being. This state is characterized by:\n\n[9]\n\n*  A lack disordered mood in patients with prior clinically diagnosed mood disorders; if sadness/anxiety/irritability are experienced they are short-lived and do not significantly impact everyday life.\n\n*  A unifying outlook on life which guides actions and feelings to shape the future.\n\n*  Being resistant to stress (resilience and anxiety or frustration tolerance).\n\nIt is worth noting that this is unlikely to be an isolated effect component but rather the result of combining an appropriate environment with other coinciding effects such as rejuvenation, introspection, personal bias suppression, and spirituality enhancement. In many cases, it may also stem from the direct neurological changes that occur as a result of a substances’ pharmacological action.\n\nEuthymia most commonly occurs at varying levels of efficacy under the influence of a range of different substances, primarily psychedelics in combination with psychotherapy\n\n[30]\n\n[31]\n\n, or dissociatives.\n\n[26]\n\nHowever, it can also occur throughout the course of prescribed psychiatric medications and under the influence of certain entactogens.\n\nA 2021 meta analysis examined 12 double-blind randomized controlled trials for classical psychedelics treating depressive symptoms.\n\n[30]\n\nA single-dose in combination with a psychotherapy treatment program created moderate to large reductions in negative mood symptoms. This reduction remained consistent at several intervals throughout the examined time-frame of 3 hours to 60 days; there were simply not enough randomized clinical trials to extend their timeframe. This effect was present in both healthy and disordered patients.\n\nA 2020 meta analysis examined 9 placebo-controlled studies for psychedelic psychotherapy.\n\n[31]\n\nThe studies had one to three doses in combination with a psychotherapy treatment program and results were measured several times over the course of 6 months. The authors' effect size indicated an 80% probability that a randomly selected patient receiving psychedelic psychotherapy outperforms a patient receiving placebo. Additionally, there were no incidents of severe adverse effects. The authors even compared their results to other meta analyses examining \"gold standard\" treatments for several mental health problems: psychedelic psychotherapy greatly outperformed.\n\nPsychotherapy with 1-3 doses of a classical psychedelic greatly outperforms current pharmacological standards in regards to producing a depression reduction all while having minimal to no adverse effects. The benefits of only needing a single dose over the course of 6 months as opposed to a daily administration of a substance incurring larger side effects and not producing desired effects until the 2-4 week mark appear obvious.\n\nScheduling activities is a behavioral treatment for depression that appears as effective as other psychological or pharmacological treatments.\n\n[10]\n\nThere is a significant relationship between mood and the number of pleasant activities engaged in. Depressed individuals find fewer activities pleasant, engage in pleasant activities less frequently, and obtain less positive reinforcement.\n\nExercise is an evidence-based treatment for depression.\n\n[11]\n\n[12]\n\n[13]\n\n[14]\n\n[23]\n\nIt also has the advantage of preventing the increased risk of drug-drug interactions. Moderate to heavy exercise of any type (including yoga) appears as effective, and do not significantly differ from, other pure forms of depression treatment such as psychotherapy or pharmacological treatment. Large changes in fitness do not appear necessary either.\n\nWARNING\n\n[27]\n\n[28]\n\n- Ketamine possesses a strong abuse potential at typical antidepressive doses. Ketamine has reported cases of severe bladder and liver injury. Esketamine, a newer nasal spray formulation of Ketamine, does not have any reported cases and is purported to have a better safety profile. However, in recent short-term clinical trials esketamine still more-than-doubled the amount of adverse bladder events when compared to placebo (6-10% vs 1-4%).  Although 2/3 of esketamine incidents resolved themselves either without intervention or through a lowering of dosage, any physiological damage is acute and immediate: in typical dose regimens steady-state concentrations are not reached.\n\nKetamine offers a (dose-dependent) large immediate depression reduction for 30-50% of patients; its effect-sizes become moderate to small by day 7.\n\n[24]\n\n[25]\n\n[29]\n\nWeekly to biweekly dosing maintains a statistically significant depression reduction measured at Day 28 and repeated administration has resulted in cases of euthymia.\n\n[26]\n\n[28]\n\nA family history of alcohol-use-disorder in a first-degree relative is associated with an improved antidepressive response, and a reduction of adverse mental effects such as dysphoria. Its antidepressant properties may also stem more generally from dissociatives' novelty and/or immersion enhancements.\n\nThere is no doubt Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is an effective treatment for adult depression.\n\n[15]\n\nThere are no large differences in efficacy between major psychotherapies for mild to moderate depression.\n\n[16]\n\nThere is also a large body of evidence supporting computerized care, and psychoeducational interventions.\n\n[17]\n\n[18]\n\n[19]\n\n[20]\n\n[21]\n\nFor patients with mild or moderate depression in natural settings, antidepressant relapse rate is high. Behavioral therapy may prevent relapses in the long-term.\n\n[22]"

These feelings can sometimes instill the person with a sensation of alienation and distance from those around them.\n\nDerealization is not an inherently negative altered state of awareness, as it does not directly affect one's emotions or thought patterns.

This loss of the sense that the external world is real can in some cases make interacting with it feel inherently inauthentic and pointless.\n\nThis state of mind is commonly associated with and often coincides with the very similar psychological state known as depersonalization. While derealization is a perception of the unreality of the outside world, depersonalization is a subjective experience of unreality in one's sense of self.\n\nDerealization is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as anxiety and depersonalization.\n\n[2]\n\nIt is most commonly induced under the influence of moderate dosages of dissociative compounds, such as ketamine, PCP, and DXM.

		"text": "Dosage independent intensity is the particularly rare and inconsistent experience of spontaneously amplified psychedelic effects that are extremely disproportionate to the dosage consumed. For example, a user may ingest a threshold dosage but spontaneously experience high-intensity effects, such as moderate to overwhelming geometry, distortions, internal hallucinations, spirituality enhancement, and even ego death.\n\nThis experience can often feel like a defiance of normal pharmacology. It usually takes the user by surprise and most commonly occurs during the peak of the trip. Individuals who experience this effect often describe it as being very profound and intense due to its unexpected and spontaneous nature. It is also worth noting that this effect seems to be most commonly reported by users that are already somewhat experienced with the substance being consumed.\n\nDosage independent intensity is most commonly induced under the influence of mild dosages of psychedelic tryptamine compounds, such as ayahuasca, psilocybin, 4-AcO-DMT, and DMT.\n\nOutside of miscalculating the amount of substance that the person is consuming, dosage independent intensity seems to be quite a rare event. However, I have heard a number of credible accounts over the years from friends, as well as a first hand experience, that truly felt as if it defied all conventional models of pharmacology.\n\nFor example, my own experience with this was under the influence of a very non-traditional ayahuasca brew. During this phase of my life, my entire circle of friends had taken to no longer bothering to brew mimosa hostilis root bark over the course of several hours into a foul tasting liquid, but were instead simply blending the product into a fine, stringy powder and masking it within banana smoothies. In conjunction with Syrian Rue taken 45 minutes beforehand, this worked incredibly well and allowed all of us to use ayahuasca in a surprisingly accessible and casual manner. On this particular night, it was my friends birthday and the two of us were planning on tripping together to celebrate it. However, when we finally got around to consuming the root bark smoothie, a single tiny strand of the root bark immediately got stuck in the back of my throat on the first sip and made me almost vomit to the point where I knew that I could not drink any further and would not be tripping tonight. I had consumed what I would estimate to be less than 1% out of what was likely in the 15 gram range of material.\n\nHowever, as we waited for my friend to come up on what was quite a heavy dosage, I began to notice that I was also coming up at the same rate and intensity as him. I was experiencing incredibly intense geometry to the point where I was having trouble seeing the room around me, alongside intense visual distortions and a multitude of cognitive effects. While this was happening, I heard a voice in my head tell me that I was being allowed to trip at this level despite my miniscule dosage because it was my friends birthday and that it would be more conducive for him to have an enjoyable evening if we were both tripping. At the time, this absolutely blew my mind and continues to baffle me to this very day.\n\nWhile I am not sure what could have caused this experience, I suspect it was because I had used ayahuasca several times before and that despite the dosage, some sort of unknown subconscious process was apparently both present and actively capable of allowing that door in my mind to open regardless. From what I have gathered, other accounts of this seem to follow similar themes that, in my opinion, have some potentially interesting implications in regards to how the subconscious mind can impact a psychedelic experience and to what extent.    This effect seems to be mentioned within the following trip reports:           The following people contributed to the content of this article:"

However, it can also occur to a lesser extent under the influence of MDMA, cannabis, and certain dissociatives, such as DXM or 3-MeO-PCP.\n\nThe various subtypes of this visual effect are defined by the continuously changing direction, speed, and rhythm of the distortion. This results in a small variety of different manifestations which are defined and listed below:\n\nMorphing can be described as a style of visual drifting that is completely disorganised and spontaneous in both its rhythm and direction. It results in objects and scenery appearing to progressively morph and warp in their size, shape, and configuration.\n\nBreathing can be described as a style of visual drifting that results in objects and scenery appearing to steadily contract inwards and expand outwards in a consistent rhythm, similar to the lungs of a living organism.\n\nMelting can be described as a style of visual drifting that results in the texture of objects and scenery appearing to completely or partially melt. It begins at lower intensities as a gradual distortion of an object's texture which causes them to subtly droop, wobble, and lose their structural integrity. This gradually increases until it becomes impossible to ignore as the lines, textures, and colour between solid objects melt into one another in an extremely fluid style.\n\nFlowing can be described as a style of visual drifting that seems to occur almost exclusively on textures (particularly if they are highly detailed, complex, or rough in appearance). It results in the textures appearing to flow like a river in a seamless, looped animation. It is particularly common on wood grain or the fur of animals.\n\nRegardless of sub-type, this effect is capable of manifesting itself across the 4 different levels of intensity described below:"

It is usually a direct result of dehydration but can be felt to occur regardless of the actual dryness of a person's mouth. At extreme levels, this effect can become so strong that it becomes extremely difficult and uncomfortable to swallow.\n\nChronic xerostomia or \"dry mouth syndrome\" is the regular and/or consistent experience of having a dry mouth that can result due to natural causes or as a product of the prolonged usage of mouth-drying substances. To treat this condition, substances such as cevimeline which stimulate the release of saliva are typically used. However, a problem noted with repeated use of such treatments is the overall worsening of the dry mouth symptoms over time. If the body adjusts to having chemical assistance in increasing saliva production cessation of treatment with the chemical can lead to physiological dependence wherein there is a rebound effect upon abrupt stopping of treatment.\n\nIn general, if the cause of dry mouth is due to a psychoactive substance, medication, or combination, medical treatment is not recommended. Dry mouth as an effect of substances is considered to be benign unless the effect is chronic and continues to bother or cause tooth/gum issues in the person experiencing it. As a basic harm reduction practice one should be mindful to stay consistently well hydrated, avoid breathing through the mouth, and limit substance usage if the effect becomes uncomfortable, unmanageable, or persists even when not under the influence of a psychoactive substance.\n\nDry mouth is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as frequent urination (due to drinking excessive amounts of water) and dehydration. It is most commonly induced under the influence of moderate dosages of a wide variety of compounds, such as stimulants, psychedelics, opioids, antispychotics, deliriants, SSRI's, and cannabinoids. It is also a common side effect of many substances, especially the combination of more than one substance which can produce or amplify already present experience of a dry mouth, which can interact significantly."

		"text": "Ego death (also known as ego suppression, ego loss or ego dissolution) is the temporary experience of a partial or complete disruption of a person's sense of self, which often results in a range of profound changes to how the person perceives and interprets their own sense of identity and the nature of agency and self-hood.\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\n[4]\n\n[5]\n\nThese changes can include but are not limited to any combination of the following three subcategories.\n\nFear of losing control is a very common occurrence when a person who undergoes ego death is not emotionally prepared, not in an appropriate set or setting, or is simply unwilling to relinquish their sense of selfhood. During this experience, the person will often find themselves experiencing overwhelming fear and anxiety relating to the fear of losing control. This fear and anxiety is especially common in those who have not experienced ego death before.\n\nTo overcome this fear, it is recommended that the person does their best to stop fighting the loss of control, and simply surrender themselves to the experience of ego death. Upon successfully relaxing into ego death, the person will often experience a radical and positive change in their emotional state.\n\nEgo death is well known for the transformative and significant impacts it can have on a person's perception of both themselves and the world around them. These responses and alterations can occur during the experience of ego death, but also in the hours, days, or weeks afterwards.\n\nA few of the most common examples of this phenomenon are described and listed below:\n\nWithin the context of psychedelic use, ego death is most commonly triggered at heavy doses by states of high level memory suppression which causes the person to forget who they are. At other times it can be triggered by or in combination with sensory overload consuming the person's consciousness with information and overwhelming their sense of self.\n\nWithin the context of dissociative use, ego death seems to be triggered at heavy doses by increasingly intense cognitive disconnection causing a person to become dissociated from cognitive functions such as the maintenance of a sense of identity.\n\nPsychedelic ego death usually occurs alongside states of level 6-7 geometry and internal hallucinations of an intense and often overwhelming nature. It may synergize with other coinciding effects such as personal bias suppression, unity and interconnectedness, spirituality enhancement, and delusions. These accompanying effects further elevate the subjective intensity and transpersonal significance of ego death experiences.\n\nDissociative ego death usually occurs alongside high level sensory disconnection and out of body experiences which may take place within voids or holes filled with hallucinatory structures. Dissociative ego death is less likely to cause an anxious response for those who are inexperienced compared to psychedelic ego death. This is because many people experience dissociatives as inherently calming and tranquil while high doses of psychedelics are quite often experienced as the opposite.\n\nOutside of psychedelics and dissociatives, it is also possible to experience ego death under the influence of a few other classes of psychoactive compounds. For example, extremely heavy doses of deliriants such as DPH or datura can result in ego death that is accompanied by delusions, psychosis, and external hallucinations. Heavy doses of salvia divinorum are extremely effective at inducing ego death that is accompanied by bizarre internal hallucinations, autonomous entity contact, and machinescapes. Although these two classes of hallucinogens function very differently on both a subjective and neuropharmacological level, both of their variations on ego death feel as if they stem from a break down or deterioration in the brain's ability to maintain normal levels of cognitive functioning."

For example, the more unfamiliar with the external environment a person is, the more likely it is that this effect will manifest itself. Cluttered areas tend to produce more external hallucinations. The amount of light within a room is inversely proportional to the intensity of them, with less light leading to significantly more hallucinations and more light leading to fewer, although more detailed, hallucinations.\n\nThe content within these external hallucinations can be further broken down into four distinct subcomponents. These are described and documented within their own dedicated articles, each of which are listed below:\n\nIt is worth noting that the content, style, and general behaviour of an external hallucination is often largely dependent on the emotional state of the person experiencing it. For example, a person who is emotionally stable and generally happy will usually be more prone to experiencing neutral, interesting, or positive hallucinations. In contrast, a person who is emotionally unstable and generally unhappy will usually be more prone to experiencing sinister, fear-inducing, and negative hallucinations.\n\nExternal hallucinations are often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as delirium, internal hallucinations and delusions. They are most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of deliriant compounds, such as DPH, datura, and benzydamine. However, they can also occur less commonly under the influence of psychedelics, dissociatives, stimulant psychosis, and sleep deprivation."

These feelings of intense concentration can allow one to continuously focus on and perform tasks that would otherwise be considered too monotonous, boring, or dull to not get distracted from.\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\nThe degree of focus induced by this effect can be much stronger than what a person is capable of sober. It can allow for hours of effortless, single-minded, and continuous focus on a particular activity to the exclusion of all other considerations such as eating and attending to bodily functions. Although focus enhancement can improve a person’s ability to engage in tasks and use time effectively, it is worth noting that it can also cause a person to focus intensely and spend excess time on unimportant activities.\n\nFocus enhancement is often accompanied by other coinciding effects, such as motivation enhancement, thought acceleration, and stimulation.

		"text": "Visual geometry was the aspect of the psychedelic experience that most quickly convinced me that these substances are incredibly profound and essential tools for humanity. Almost a decade ago as a young 17-year-old undergoing my first couple of hallucinogenic experiences, I found myself immediately fascinated by the sheer incomprehensibility of the beautiful patterns which my mind was producing. Not only were these geometric patterns complex beyond anything I had ever seen, but they were so impossibly complex in their forms that I perhaps naively believed if even a short recording of high-level geometry could be somehow brought back to the real world, it would change the face of society forever.\n\nBased on my personal experiences, I firmly believe that geometry is not simply another form of hallucination, but instead a result of neurological signals and processes from various regions of the brain bleeding into the visual cortex and being reinterpreted as complex geometric forms in a manner which is comparable to that of synaesthesia. This would explain multiple aspects of the effects behaviour, such as the way in which geometry commonly feels as if it is an innately understandable visual representation of one's emotional state, sensory input, and even complex concepts or thoughts. If this is true, it implies that psychedelic geometry is the profound experience of being able to indirectly see the hidden architecture and complex programming of human consciousness.\n\nAnother aspect of geometry that myself and others have found very intriguing is that psychedelic geometry often follows the aesthetic themes of various artwork and writing styles from historical societies, such as Aztecs, Mayans, Egyptians, Tibetans, etc.\n\nBased purely upon my own potentially flawed speculation, there are a couple of relatively plausible explanations behind this. Perhaps our culture simply associates psychedelia with mysticism and ancient societies in a manner which results in these themes displaying themselves within our collective experience of psychedelic geometry. Perhaps these societies experienced the very same imagery under the influence of psychedelic plants and took inspiration from this within their artwork, architecture, and alphabets. Maybe psychedelic geometry manifests itself in a manner which is, on some level, a visual representation of the same neurological processes that allowed ancient humans to create language and artwork in the first place, thus generating a variety of somewhat consistent aesthetic themes throughout the humans that experience them, regardless of their cultural or historical context.\n\nNevertheless, none of these speculative ideas feel particularly satisfactory to me, but I do still hope that this particular aspect of psychedelic geometry is more closely examined and understood on a a scientific level within my lifetime."

This is likely a result of the effect synergizing with other accompanying components, such as internal or external hallucinations, delusions, memory suppression, and increased suggestibility. Immersion enhancement often exaggerates the emotional response a person has towards media they are engaged with. Whether or not this experience is enjoyable can differ drastically depending on various factors, such as the emotional tone and familiarity of what is being perceived.\n\nImmersion enhancement is most commonly induced under the influence of moderate dosages of dissociative compounds, such as ketamine, PCP, and DXM.

		"text": "Increased suggestibility is a greater tendency to accept and act on the suggestions of others.\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\nA common example of increased suggestibility in action would be a trip sitter deliberately making a person believe a false statement without question simply by telling it to them as true, even if the statement would usually be easily recognizable as impossible or absurd. If this is successfully accomplished, it can potentially result in the experience of relevant accompanying hallucinations and delusions which further solidify the belief which has been suggested to them.\n\nIncreased suggestibility most commonly occurs under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogenic compounds, such as psychedelics, dissociatives, deliriants, and cannabinoids. This holds particularly true for users who are inexperienced or currently undergoing delusions and memory suppression. It's worth noting that this effect has been studied extensively by the scientific literature and has a relatively large body of data confirming its presence across multiple hallucinogens.

		"text": "An internal hallucination is the perception of a visual hallucination that exclusively occurs within an imagined environment that can typically only be viewed with closed eyes,\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\nsimilar to those found within dreams.\n\n[3]\n\n[4]\n\n[5]\n\nThis is in stark contrast to external hallucinations, which display themselves seamlessly into the person's surrounding environment as if they were physically present.\n\nAt lower levels, internal hallucinations begin with imagery on the back of a person's eyelids, which do not take up the entirety of one's visual field and are distinct from their background. These can be described as spontaneous moving or still images of scenes, concepts, places, or anything one could imagine. The imagery is manifested in varying levels of realism ranging from ill-defined and cartoon-like to wholly realistic. They rarely hold their form for more than a few seconds before fading or shifting into another image. It is worth noting that this level of intensity occurs in a manner similar to that of hypnagogia, the state between sleep and wakefulness.\n\nAt higher levels, internal hallucinations become increasingly elaborate as they eventually become all-encompassing, fully-fledged 3D scenes that surround the person in a manner similar to that of dreams. This can create the feeling that one has \"broken-through\" into another reality. The things that occur within this perceived alternate reality can be anything, but fall under common archetypes such as contact with autonomous entities, alongside a wide variety of imagined landscapes and scenarios.\n\nThis effect is capable of manifesting itself across the 5 different levels of intensity described below:\n\nOutside of this levelling system, the subjective intensity of internal hallucinations are not only dependent on their detail or level of immersion, but also upon the speed and rate at which they successively occur between each other. For example, during the experience of internal hallucinations, it is possible to find oneself in a state that presents a relentless stream of intensely vivid hallucinations. This occurs at such a rapid rate that it eventually becomes psychologically exhausting to endure them, regardless of their thematic content. The sheer amount of content experienced in this state often results in powerful time dilation, which seems to stem from the fact that abnormally large amounts of experiences are being felt in very short periods of time. This is also consistently accompanied by states of sensory overload and ego death in a manner that can subjectively feel as if it is a consequence of the brain allocating all of its processing power into rendering hallucinations at the expense of other cognitive faculties.\n\nThe content within these internal hallucinations can be further broken down into four distinct sub-components. These are described and documented within their own dedicated articles, each of which are listed below:\n\nIt is worth noting that the content, style, and general behaviour of an internal hallucination is often largely dependent on the emotional state of the person experiencing it. For example, a person who is emotionally stable and generally happy will usually be more prone to experiencing neutral, interesting, or positive hallucinations. In contrast, however, a person who is emotionally unstable and generally unhappy will usually be more prone to experiencing sinister, fear-inducing, and negative hallucinations.\n\nInternal hallucinations are often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as geometry, external hallucinations and delusions. They are most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogenic compounds, such as psychedelics, dissociatives, and deliriants. However, they can also occur under the influence of stimulant psychosis, sleep deprivation, and during dreams."

However, the ability to speak and to process the speech of others does necessarily become suppressed simultaneously.

The person knows what she/he wants to say, but cannot find the words he needs. For example, a person with Broca's aphasia may say,  meaning, \"I will take the dog for a walk,\" or  for \"There are two books on the table.\"\n\n*   (Wernicke's aphasia): difficulty understanding spoken or written language. The individual hears the voice or sees the print but cannot make sense of the words. These people may speak in long, complete sentences that have no meaning, adding unnecessary words and even creating made-up words. For example,  \"You know that smoodle pinkered and that I want to get him round and take care of him like you want before.\"  As a result, it is often difficult to follow what the person is trying to say and the speakers are often unaware of their spoken mistakes.\n\n*  : People lose almost all language function, both comprehension and expression. They cannot speak or understand speech, nor can they read or write. This results from severe and extensive damage to the language areas of the brain. They may be unable to say even a few words or may repeat the same words or phrases over and over again.\n\n*   (or amnesiac):  the least severe form of aphasia; people have difficulty in using the correct names for particular objects, people, places, or events.\n\nLanguage suppression is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as analysis suppression and thought deceleration. It is most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of antipsychotic compounds, such as quetiapine\n\n[3]\n\n, haloperidol\n\n[4]\n\n, and risperidone\n\n[5]\n\n.

The physical action itself typically consists of rhythmical, often audible contractions of the diaphragm and other parts of the respiratory system. At higher levels, laughter fits can make it extremely difficult to function due to crying and a difficulty talking or keeping one's eyes open.\n\nLaughter fits are often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as an increased sense of humor and emotion enhancement. They are most commonly induced under the influence of moderate dosages of psychedelic and dissociative compounds, such as LSD, psilocybin, and nitrous oxide."

		"text": "This particular subjective effect component may not be the most profound, therapeutic, or spiritual state of mind available within the hallucinogenic experience. However, in my personal opinion, it is quite likely to be one of the most uniquely baffling and inexplicable effects when it comes to both undergoing it and considering the causes behind it. While I may not have a particularly in-depth academic knowledge of neurology and psychopharmacology, the vast majority of subjective effects that occur under the influence of hallucinogenic substances at least have some sort of vaguely plausible mechanism or cause that I can immediately speculate upon. In contrast, however, I have struggled for years to come up with a satisfying hypothesis on why Salvia Divinorum can cause human brains to quite reliably create states in which a person's awareness and felt bodily form suddenly becomes enveloped by rotating panels, conveyer belts, pulleys, gears, and all manner of other interlocking mechanical parts.\n\nAt face value, I would initially assume that machinescapes are simply a type of hallucination that occurs among people as a result of the cultural influence of living in a world in which we are all acutely aware of the existence of machinery. However, the fact that this experience is so consistently reported by people under the influence of a very specific compound leads me to believe that there is at least a little more to it than that. This is especially interesting to consider in the context of Salvia Divinorum's unique pharmacology, in which it functions as a potent k-opioid receptor agonist. While the k-opioid receptor system is not well understood, it is known that these receptors have the highest prevalence within the claustrum, a system that is the most densely connected structure in the brain and that's been shown to have widespread activity throughout numerous cortical components. These are associated with playing key roles in consciousness, higher cognitive functioning, and sustained attention. It is further theorised that the claustrum harmonises and coordinates activity in various parts of the cortex in a manner that leads to the seamlessly integrated nature of subjective conscious experience. All of this suggests to me that this unique hallucinogen is creating disruptions and changes to brain function that occur on a much deeper, widespread, and fundamental level than that of psychedelics, dissociatives, and deliriants.\n\nWhen taking this knowledge into consideration, I am led to suspect that machinescapes may occur under the influence of salvia due to the way this substance reliably disrupts consciousness on an all-encompassing level. If I had to guess I would say that this could potentially cause the experience of machinescapes to occur in a number of ways. For example, perhaps it causes the brain's internal map of the bodies form to reassemble in complex and unpredictable ways, which are then accompanied by visual hallucinations that are commonly interpreted as interlocking mechanical parts. It may also trigger data from various parts of the brain to spill over into areas in unusual and complex ways, that they would usually otherwise not, resulting in this data being interpreted as a more simplistic but mechanical-esque equivalent to psychedelic geometry accompanied by an equivalent tactile sensation. It could also potentially be a unique form of internal hallucination that the brain will often render when it is largely incapable of drawing from its memory database of more coherent everyday concepts. Alternatively, however, this experience may be a result of a combination of these factors, or an entirely different process altogether. Unfortunately, none of these speculative ideas feel particularly satisfactory to me and I also sincerely doubt that the causes behind this incredibly niche experience will be understood at a scientific level within my lifetime."

The typical symptoms of mania are the following: heightened mood (either euphoric or irritable), thought acceleration, a flooding of ideas, extreme talkativeness, increased energy, a decreased need for sleep, and hyperactivity.\n\n[1]\n\nThis state of mind can vary wildly in its intensity, from mild mania (hypomania)\n\n[2]\n\nto full-on manic psychosis\n\n[3]\n\n. The accompanying symptoms are most obvious during states of fully developed delirious mania in which the person exhibits increasingly severe manic tendencies that become more and more obscured by other signs and symptoms, such as delusions, psychosis, incoherence, catatonia and extreme disorderly behaviour.\n\n[4]\n\nWithin the context of clinical psychology, standardized tools such as Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale\n\n[5]\n\nand Young Mania Rating Scale\n\n[6]\n\ncan be used to measure the severity of manic episodes. It is worth noting that since mania and hypomania is often associated with creativity and artistic talent,\n\n[7]\n\nit is not always the case that a clearly manic person needs or wants medical help; such persons often either retain sufficient self-control to function normally or are simply unaware that they are severely manic enough to be committed to a psychiatric ward or to commit themselves.\n\nAlthough mania is often stereotyped as a “mirror image” of depression, the heightened mood can be either euphoric or irritable. As irritable mania worsens, the irritability often becomes more pronounced and may eventually result in violent behaviour.\n\nMania is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as ego inflation and stimulation. It is most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of stimulant or dissociative compounds, such as methamphetamine, PCP, 2-Oxo-PCE, and cocaine.\n\nHypomania is a lowered state of mania that does little to impair function or decrease the person's quality of life. It may, in fact, increase productivity and creativity. In hypomania, there is less need for sleep and an increase in both goal-motivated behaviour and physical metabolism. Though the elevated mood and energy levels typical of hypomania could be seen as a benefit, mania itself generally has many undesirable consequences including suicidal tendencies, and hypomania can, if the prominent mood is irritable rather than euphoric, be a rather unpleasant experience. By definition, hypomania cannot feature psychosis, nor does it require psychiatric hospitalisation (voluntary or involuntary)."

Although people can usually identify the environmental triggers responsible for their mixed emotions, the subjective feeling reflects the simultaneous occurrence of both positive and negative emotions.

Many people test the purity of their cocaine by rubbing it in their mouth.

This effect usually occurs at the onset of the experience and dissipates as the peak takes its toll.\n\nIn the context of substance usage, nausea and vomiting can occur as a result of stomach irritation through the consumption of materials which it is not used to digesting. These materials can include things such as chemical powders or plant matter. Alternatively, nausea may occur as a direct pharmacological result of how the particular substance affects the brain. If this is the case, the nausea is therefore inseparable from the experience itself and will likely occur to varying extents regardless of the route of administration.\n\nNausea is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as stomach bloating, stomach cramps, and dizziness. It is most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of a wide variety of compounds, such as psychedelics, opioids, GABAergics, deliriants, dissociatives, and stimulants.\n\nVomiting, also known as purging, puking and throwing up, among other terms, is the involuntary, forceful expulsion of the contents of one's stomach through the mouth and sometimes the nose. This effect typically occurs during the peak of a substance's effects. It can often greatly relieve the person's physical side effects once it is over. For example, under the influence of many hallucinogenic compounds, it is common for a person to feel that their trip has become significantly more enjoyable after the act of vomiting due to their uncomfortable stomach symptoms suddenly subsiding as a result.\n\nIt is worth noting that a person should not brush their teeth immediately after vomiting. This is because the corrosiveness of stomach acid combined with the abrasiveness of brushing can cause permanent damage to a person's teeth when repeated over time. Instead, a person should wash their mouth out with water, mouthwash, a water flosser, or a mixture of baking soda and water (to neutralise the acidity)."

For example, a door may open and close on its own or a cup on the table may start to slide or tilt over. The \"activated object\" usually moves in a familiar way that would happen in day to day life, implying that the person is experiencing a combination of both object alterations and external hallucinations being applied to their environment.\n\nHowever, certain activated objects may also perform actions that are completely unrealistic. For example, an item of furniture may appear to disassemble into many complex, floating, and rotating sections before reassembling into its previous form. Stationary objects, such as rugs, may activate themselves and begin crawling on the floor and up onto other stationary pieces of furniture. These hallucinations usually only occur when one looks directly at an object for an extended period of time and are rare and extreme signs of an advanced hallucinatory state.\n\nIn rare cases, autonomous entities such as shadow people may aid in an object's activation. A shadow person or other autonomous entity may pick up, rearrange, or move a stationary object in front of the observer and act as a \"cause\" of the object's activation.\n\nObject activation is often accompanied by other coinciding effects, such as delirium, psychosis, cognitive dysphoria, and delusions in a manner that can result in the hallucinations being perceived to have distinctly sinister and unsettling undertones. It is most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of deliriant compounds, such as DPH, datura, and benzydamine.

Panic attacks may be unexpected, in which the onset of the attack is not associated with an obvious trigger and instead occurs \"out of the blue,\" or expected, in which the panic attack is associated with an obvious trigger, either internal or external.\n\n[1]\n\nPanic attacks are usually triggered in moments of severe anxiety, such as that caused by a bad trip. They are so subjectively overwhelming both physically and mentally that the user may believe they are dying, or that some great calamity is imminent, and are commonly mistaken for heart attacks. The subjective sensations can overwhelm rational thought even when the user recognizes that they are having a panic attack, especially in those who have not experienced them before.\n\nPanic attacks are often accompanied by uncomfortable physical symptoms that may further aggravate a person’s anxiety as they may be mistaken for a serious health problem. The strongest mental effect of panic attacks is a crushing sense of impending doom,\n\n[1]\n\naccompanied by despair, panic, and dread. These usually begin abruptly and may reach their peak within 10 to 20 minutes, but may also continue for hours in extreme cases before subsiding on their own. Although this experience is incredibly stressful it is important to note that it is not physically dangerous or harmful.\n\nThe various cognitive and physical symptoms of a panic attack are described and listed below:\n\n*   - Hyperventilation occurs when one breathes deeper and more rapidly than usual. When hyperventilating, one may feel as though they are struggling to get enough air. As this causes a decrease of carbon dioxide in the blood, it may result in lightheadedness, a rapid heartbeat, chest pain, or a tingling sensation in a person's limbs.\n\n*   - Due to the release of stress hormones, one may experience heart symptoms including missed beats, palpitations, chest pain, and an accelerated heart rate.\n\n*   - This can be described as a loss of sensation as well as numbness and tingling sensations throughout the body. It may feel as if one's skin or body parts are numb to the touch, and this can occur in a small area or become all-encompassing throughout multiple body parts or the entire body. Numbness most frequently occurs within the hands, legs, arms, feet, and face. This effect is often accompanied by a pins and needle sensation and it generally increases alongside of - hyperventilation.\n\n*   Fear of losing control or going insane"

		"text": "Perception of eternalism is one of a handful of subjective effect components that has had a substantial impact on how I view myself and the universe around me. I first experienced this effect during a state of level 4 unity and interconnectedness while under the influence of a heavy dose of Ayahuasca. It was one of the most profound experiences of my entire life. I truly felt that not only was I the entirety of existence experiencing itself through this body, but that this moment and all other moments would continue to exist eternally within their specific time frames. Although I am acutely aware of how it is impossible for me to genuinely know if this is true or not, I have found it to be a perspective that is very difficult to shake off after having this experience a number of times.\n\nBefore experiencing this effect, I had never considered or even heard of the various similar metaphysical schools of thought that exist as relatively mainstream concepts within the field of philosophy. However, after having had experienced this state of mind numerous times, I happened upon a large number of relevant concepts that include ideas such as eternalism, four dimensionalism, growing block universe, perdurantism, and the b-theory of time. Each of these concepts have their Wikipedia articles linked to within the See Also section of this page.\n\nAs an intellectual concept, the B-theory of time is especially interesting to me as it is relatively well supported by the physics community. In summary, B-theory posits that the flow of time is an illusion, that the past, present, and future are equally real and that time is tenseless. Its support is seemingly due to its apparent compatibility with theoretical physics and the fact that many theories such as special relativity, the ADD model, and brane cosmology are considered to point to a theory of time similar to B-theory. However, I feel that it is important to note that I do not have a remotely in-depth understanding of theoretical physics and that although these theories are in support of notions similar to this experience, I am not entirely sure that their ontological implications can be asserted within science and outside the realm of philosophy or metaphysics.\n\nRegardless of whether or not the nature of time is genuinely illusory, it is truly fascinating to me that without any prior knowledge, myself and many other psychedelic users can experience incredibly specific states of mind that seem to line up with entire philosophical theories. This holds true for a number of transpersonal effects and is something that I'm deeply passionate about doing my absolute best to both document and discuss without descending into any degree of pseudoscience or hippy babble."

This is accompanied by the absence of the feeling that a person's decision-making processes and general cognitive faculties inherently possess \"free will”. This sudden change in perspective causes the person to feel as if their personal choices, physical actions, and individual personality traits have always been completely predetermined by prior causes and are, therefore, outside of their conscious control.\n\nDuring this state, a person begins to feel as if their decisions arise from a complex set of internally stored, pre-programmed, and completely autonomous, instant electrochemical responses to perceived sensory input. These sensations are often interpreted as somehow disproving the concept of free will, as the experience of this effect feels as if it is fundamentally incompatible with the notion of being self-determined. This state can also lead a person to the conclusion that their very identity and selfhood are the cumulative results of their biology and past experiences.\n\nOnce the effect begins to wear off, a person will often return to their everyday feelings of freedom and independence. Despite this, however, they will often retain realizations regarding what is often interpreted as a profound insight into the apparent illusory nature of free will.\n\nPerception of predeterminism is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as ego death and physical autonomy.

For example, thoughts such as \"go to the toilet\" or \"go drink a glass of water\" can result in the body performing these actions autonomously. This can often help the person perform necessary physical actions such as tending to bodily functions or avoiding danger when they would otherwise be too incapable, unconscious, or distractible to perform them manually in their current state.\n\nAt higher levels, this effect no longer requires verbal commands and becomes entirely automatic. It's worth noting that although this technically results in a loss of cognitive control, the body only performs actions which the owner would have decided to perform were they capable of it themselves.\n\nPhysical autonomy is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as physical disconnection and cognitive disconnection.

It most commonly affects the legs but can also affect the arms, torso, and head. During this state, moving the affected body part reduces the uncomfortable sensations, providing temporary relief.\n\nRLS sensations can range from pain, an aching in the muscles, \"an itch you can't scratch\", an unpleasant \"tickle that won't stop\", or even a crawling feeling.

These behave in an almost identical fashion to the plots and scenarios that occur during ordinary dream states and often include cognitive delusions that result in one accepting the plot as a real-life event. On rare occasions, however, they will be immediately recognized as a mere hallucination and not a real-life event.\n\nDuring this effect, the typical components that comprise standard hallucinatory states (settings, sceneries, and landscapes and autonomous entities) begin behaving and co-operating in a manner that results in the experience of events occurring within the hallucination itself. These are often perceived as linear and coherent plots that occur in a logical sequence by leading into other events through normal cause and effect. However, they are equally likely to present themselves as completely nonsensical and incoherent. For example, they may consist of nonlinear or spontaneous events that are capable of ending, starting, and changing between each other repeatedly in quick succession.\n\nThese hallucinated plots can consist of new experiences that are completely unlike the real world, old experiences such as accurate memory replays, or a combination of the two. However, in terms of their precise content, this effect is impossible to define in a comprehensive manner in much the same way that one cannot predict the exact plot of unknown literature and films. They can, however, be summarized as basic occurrences that often entail visiting a setting containing interactive objects and autonomous entities. It is also worth noting that the possible situations one may find themselves in as a result of this effect can be either positive or negative to experience depending on both its content and the individual undergoing them.\n\nHallucinatory plots and scenarios usually feel as if they are being experienced in real-time. For example, when 20 seconds has passed within the hallucination, the same amount of time will usually have passed in the real world. At other points, however, time-distortions can cause plots and scenarios to feel as if they last days, weeks, months, years, aeons, or infinitely extended periods of time.\n\nScenarios and plots are most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogenic compounds, such as psychedelics, dissociatives, and deliriants. However, they can also occur less commonly under the influence of stimulant psychosis and sleep deprivation."

Its symptoms can range from mild, to severe, and even fatal.\n\nIn milder cases, symptoms include high blood pressure and a fast heart rate; usually without a fever. In moderate cases, symptoms include a high body temperature, agitation, increased reflexes, shakiness, sweating, dilated pupils, and diarrhea. In severe cases, however, body temperature can increase to greater than 41.1 C (106.0 F). This can result in complications including seizures, extensive muscle breakdown, and even death.\n\nSerotonin syndrome is most commonly induced when recklessly combining multiple serotonergic substances, especially those which function as serotonin releasers or reuptake inhibitors. To varying degrees, common examples of these  include various combinations of the following substances:\n\nHowever, this list is far from comprehensive. If you are considering combining multiple substances, it is incredibly important to do your own research.

However, they may also manifest as a non-linear, nonsensical, and continuously changing layout that does not obey the laws of physics. The chosen locations, appearance, and style of these settings may be entirely new and previously unseen locations; however, there is a large influence towards replicating and combining real-life locations stored within a person's memories. There are some common themes and archetypes within this component which generally include:\n\nJungles, rainforests, deserts, ice-scapes, cities, natural environments, caves, space habitats, vast structures, civilizations, technological utopias, ancient ruins, machinescapes, historical settings, rooms and other indoor environments, real-life locations, incomprehensible geometric landscapes, and more.\n\nIt is worth noting that the content, style, and general behaviour of a setting is often largely dependent on the emotional state of the person experiencing it. For example, a person who is emotionally stable and generally happy will be more prone to experiencing neutral, interesting, or positive settings. In contrast, however, a person who is emotionally unstable and generally unhappy will be more prone to experiencing sinister, fear-inducing, and negative settings.\n\nSettings, sceneries, and landscapes are often accompanied by other coinciding effects, such as autonomous entities and delusions. They are most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogenic compounds, such as psychedelics, dissociatives, and deliriants.

		"text": "Shadow people are the experience of perceiving patches of shadow in one's peripheral or direct line of sight to appear and behave as living, autonomous beings.\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\nDue to the unique behaviour of these hallucinations, they can be considered a distinct subtype of autonomous entities.\n\nShadow people usually appear initially as fleeting images in a person's peripheral vision. However, at higher levels of intensity, shadow people may appear in full view. This allows the user to directly look at one in their central line of sight. At higher levels of intensity, it becomes possible to look away from and back to a shadow person without a change in the presence or appearance of the hallucination.\n\nThe bodies of shadow people are usually perceived as being comprised of blackness that has a sense of depth and few facial or body features. The blackness of their bodies often seem almost opaque, as if one is looking into a \"black hole\" in humanoid form. They may also appear in the shape of animals, uniform blobs, disembodied body parts, or a myriad of other indescribable shapes. They sometimes appear to have faces, eyes, or mouths and are able to move or change shape. The movement exhibited can be normal human movement or it can be faster, slower, or choppier than a normal person's gait. It is also possible for multiple shadow people to occupy one's field of vision simultaneously while acting autonomously from one another, sometimes even interacting with each other.\n\nIt is worth noting that the style and general behaviour of a shadow person are often largely dependent on the emotional state of the person experiencing it. For example, a person who is emotionally stable and generally happy will be more prone to experiencing neutral, interesting, or friendly shadow people. In contrast, however, a person who is emotionally unstable and generally unhappy will be more prone to experiencing sinister and fear-inducing shadow people.\n\nShadow people are often accompanied by other coinciding effects, such as delirium, paranoia, anxiety, and feelings of impending doom. They are most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of deliriant compounds, such as DPH, datura, and benzydamine. However, they can also occur under the influence of stimulant psychosis, sleep deprivation, and during sleep paralysis.\n\n[4]\n\nAlthough it is uncommon and not an intrinsic part of this hallucinatory effect, shadow people can be accompanied by other sensory components alongside of the person's visual perception of them. This usually only occurs during very intense states of sleep deprivation, delirium, or psychosis. For example, shadow people can potentially have an accompanying \"voice\", despite the lack of a visible mouth structure. This auditory communication follows an identical levelling system of progressively more detailed and coherent speech similar to a generic autonomous entity. Shadow people may converse with the person experiencing them or they may converse amongst each other, sometimes talking about the person going through the experience.\n\nAlongside accompanying auditory hallucinations, shadow people may also present tactile and gustatory hallucinations. This is even rarer than their potential auditory effects and typically only occurs in particularly intense and advanced hallucinatory states. Their tactile effects can be indistinguishable from a real human touch and may vary in temperature. They can also include physical actions, such as pulling on clothing, hair, or one's skin."

		"text": "A stomach cramp can be described as an intense feeling of sudden pain or discomfort which occurs within the stomach.\n\nIn the context of substance usage, stomach cramps can occur as a result of stomach irritation through the consumption of materials which it is not used to digesting. These materials can include things such as chemical powders or plant matter. Alternatively, cramps may occur as a direct pharmacological result of how the particular substance affects the brain. If this is the case, the stomach cramps are therefore inseparable from the experience itself and will likely occur to varying extents regardless of the route of administration.\n\nStomach cramps are often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as stomach bloating, nausea, and vomiting.

A common example of suggestibility suppression in action would be a person being unwilling to believe or trust another person's suggestions without a greater amount of prior discussion than would usually be considered necessary during every day sobriety.\n\nAlthough this effect can occur as a distinct mindstate, it may also arise due to interactions between a number of other effects. For example, a person who is currently experiencing mild paranoia combined with analysis enhancement may find themselves less trusting and more inclined to think through the suggestions of others before acting upon them, alternatively, a person who is experiencing ego inflation may find that they value their own opinion over others and are therefore equally less likely to follow the suggestions of others.\n\nAlcohol has been shown to decrease suggestibility in a dose-dependent manner,\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\nwhile its withdrawals increases suggestibility.\n\n[3]\n\nA large proportion of individuals who come in contact with law enforcement personnel are under the influence of alcohol, including perpetrators, victims, and witnesses of crimes. This has to be taken into account when investigative interviews are planned and conducted, and when the reliability of the information derived from such interviews is evaluated.\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\nSuggestibility suppression is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as irritability\n\n[1]\n\nand ego inflation.

However, the specific situations in which suggestibility suppression will or will not occur under the influence of these compounds remains unpredictable and seemingly depends on the individual's gender or specific personality traits.\n\n[4]\n\n[5]"

It can be extremely disorientating to undergo this effect and it often triggers states of progressive anxiety within people who may be unfamiliar with the experience. The most effective way to end a cycle of thought loops is to simply sit down and try to let go.\n\nThis state of mind is most likely to occur during states of memory suppression in which there is a partial or complete failure of the person's short-term memory. This may suggest that thought loops are the result of cognitive processes becoming unable to sustain themselves for appropriate lengths of time due to a lapse in short-term memory, resulting in the thought process attempting to restart from the beginning only to fall short once again in a perpetual cycle.\n\nWhen this effect occurs in conjunction with high level internal hallucinations, it often results in the hallucinatory scenarios repeating themselves in the same way the person's thoughts are. These looped hallucinations can remain exactly the same with each repetition, but will often change in their overall details while maintaining specific themes and elements throughout each iteration.\n\nThought loops are most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogenic compounds,\n\n[1]\n\nsuch as psychedelics and dissociatives.

		"text": "Time distortion is an effect that makes the passage of time feel wildly altered and difficult to keep track of.\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\nIt can occur in form of four distinct subtypes, which are documented below.\n\nTime dilation is the feeling that time has slowed down.\n\n[4]\n\n[5]\n\nThis can create the perception that more time has passed than it actually has. For example, at the end of hallucinogenic experiences which typically last no longer than several hours, one may feel that they have subjectively undergone days, weeks, months, years, or even infinite periods of time.\n\nTime dilation is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as spirituality enhancement, novelty enhancement, thought loops, novelty enhancement, and internal hallucinations. This is seemingly because these particular effects can result in a person perceiving a disproportionately large number of novel events occurring within a much smaller frame of time than they usually would.\n\nTime dilation is most commonly induced under the influence of strong dosages of hallucinogenic compounds, such as psychedelics\n\n[6]\n\n, dissociatives\n\n[7]\n\n, and cannabinoids\n\n[8]\n\n. However, it also commonly occurs during moments of extreme stress and fear.\n\n[9]\n\nTime compression is the experience of time speeding up and passing much quicker than it usually would.\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[10]\n\nFor example, during this state, a person may realize that an entire day or evening has passed them by in what feels like only a couple of hours.\n\nThis commonly occurs under the influence of stimulating compounds such as amphetamines and entactogens. With these particular substances, time compression seems to at least partially stem from the fact that during intense levels of stimulation and focus-enhancement, people typically become hyper-fixated on activities and tasks in a manner that causes them to both keep track of time less effectively and also become more likely to ignore any events which may be unfolding around them.\n\nHowever, the same experience also commonly occurs in a different manner while under the influence of depressant compounds which induce amnesia, such as alcohol, GHB, and benzodiazepines. This is seemingly due to the way in which a person can forget events that occurred under the influence of the particular substance, thus giving the impression that they have suddenly jumped forward in time.\n\nTime reversal is the experience of perceiving the events that occurred around oneself within the previous several minutes or several hours, spontaneously playing backwards in a manner similar to that of a rewinding VHS tape. During this reversal, the person's cognition and train of thought typically continues to play forward in a coherent and linear manner while they watch the external environment around them and their body's physical actions play in reverse. It is speculated that the experience of time reversal may potentially occur through a combination of visual hallucinations and errors in memory encoding.\n\nTime reversal is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as internal hallucinations, thought loops, and deja vu. It is most commonly induced under the influence of extremely heavy dosages of hallucinogenic compounds, such as psychedelics, dissociatives, and deliriants.\n\nAtemporality is the experience of feeling as if one's conscious awareness is now outside of, disconnected from, and uninfluenced by the normal passage of linear time. During this state, there is often a sense that the flow of time has ceased to function and has also become inherently meaningless.\n\nWhile experiencing atemporality, one’s ability to conceptualize ordinary time may be compromised in several ways. For example, the concept of ‘one hour’ may no longer make any sense. As a different example, the concepts of ‘one second’ and ‘one year’ may both seem like a single well-defined unit. The paradoxical sensation of ‘existing’ outside of time is also often connected to reports of being unable to adequately describe this effect using ordinary language.\n\nAtemporality is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as perception of eternalism and ego death. It is most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of psychedelic compounds, such as LSD, DMT, psilocybin, and mescaline.\n\nAn experience of transcending time is also one among many criteria assessed by the MEQ-30, which is a standardized questionnaire used in clinical research observing how psychedelic-induced mystical experiences can occasion positive long-term changes in patients’ mental health.\n\n[11]"

		"text": "Transformations are the experience of a perceived visual metamorphosis that specific parts of one's external environment undergo as they shapeshift into other objects. For example, people who experience this effect will often report seeing parts of their environment shifting into completely different things. These transformations have a huge variety of potential artistic styles and differing levels of detail, realism, and animation.\n\nThese hallucinations are progressive in nature. They form from patterns or objects and their appearance fluidly drifts into an entirely new form over several seconds. This is caused and enhanced by a separate visual effect known as increased pareidolia, which can cause vague stimuli and objects to transform into incredibly detailed versions of what they were already perceived as.\n\nAt lower levels, the process of transformations can require a minimal amount of focus and concentration to sustain. Losing concentration for an instant can cause the image to fade away or shift into another image. Holding the eyes still will usually increase the intensity of the progressive transformation. However, this becomes completely unnecessary at higher levels.\n\nIt is worth noting that the content, style, and general behaviour of a transformation is often largely dependent on the emotional state of the person experiencing it. For example, a person who is emotionally stable and generally happy will be more prone to experiencing neutral and interesting transformations. In contrast, however, a person who is emotionally unstable and generally unhappy will be more prone to experiencing sinister and fear-inducing transformations.\n\nTransformations are often accompanied by other coinciding effects, such as drifting, increased pareidolia and external hallucinations. They are most commonly induced under the influence of moderate dosages of psychedelic compounds, such as LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline. However, they can also occur under the influence of deliriants such as DPH, datura, and benzydamine."

		"text": "Without any question or hesitation, I undoubtedly believe that this particular transpersonal effect is by far the most important and significant state of mind the psychedelic experience has to offer. I have been fascinated by this effect for around a decade now and first came to learn of its existence as a teenager through the numerous first hand accounts given to me by my close friends. This effect was further solidified in my mind as something of extreme significance after I found the works of Alan Watts through his philosophical lectures and writings. I then proceeded to dive headfirst into meditation and obsessively contemplating the supposedly illusory nature of the self on a daily basis. I even found that on more than one occasion, I could lead people into experiencing states of high level unity by simply saying the right words to them during heavy psychedelic trips.\n\nHowever, despite my borderline obsession with this subjective effect and its associated philosophical frameworks, I found that no matter how heavy a dosage of a psychedelic I consumed, I could never experience this state of mind for myself. This led me to the conclusion that regardless of how common an occurrence this effect was for many other experienced psychedelic users, my extreme fascination with it must be the exact thing that is preventing me from experiencing it for myself. This caused me to inevitably let my guard down for what was to come. Approximately two years later while under the influence of ayahuasca, I spontaneously found myself undergoing a state of level 4 unity for the first time in my life. This happened on two separate occasions within a month and, at the time, were by far the most profound and lifechanging psychedelic experiences I had ever undergone in my entire life.\n\nIn the years after these two experiences, I have since undergone states of unity on two other occasions, both of which were under the influence of 4-HO-MET and also less than a month apart. These experiences seemingly came out of nowhere and I cannot for the life of me understand or figure out any causal factors or correlations behind the triggering of this state of mind.  As far as I can tell, it seems that certain individuals are much more prone to it than others, but almost everybody will inevitably experience this if they trip regularly enough over a long period of time. It does not seem to be dependent on the dosage or the psychedelic in question, although set and setting seems to be at least somewhat of a factor. Situations involving beautiful nature, deep contemplation, and philosophical conversation can often cause it to come about, but not in a reliable or reproducible fashion. It therefore seems that states of unity and interconnectedness must arise organically and out of a situation in which the person either comes to a conclusion of their own accord, or perhaps where some subconscious process of the mind is allowed to independently arise in an autonomous manner.\n\nAt this point, I cannot deny that I personally believe the common conception of a separate self is merely a construct of human perception. In fact, I would go even further and state that based upon my extensive research, this widely held position is both philosophically and scientifically justifiable. However, I want to make it clear that I do not have any desire to convince people of that here. Instead, I simply aim to document the subjective experience of this perspective in a manner that is as comprehensive and reasonable as possible. This is with the hope that people far more intelligent than me can someday use this article as a template for furthering our collective understanding of this profound and absolutely fascinating state of mind."

		"text": "Visual disconnection is the experience of becoming distanced and/or detached from one's sense of vision. At its lower levels, this results in visual acuity suppression, double-vision, visual agnosia, and frame rate suppression. This experience can create a wide range of subjective changes to a person's perception of their own vision. These are described and documented in the list below:\n\n* Feeling as if one is watching the world through a screen\n\n* Feeling as if the visually perceivable world is further away in distance\n\n* Feeling as if one is looking at the world through someone else's eyes\n\n* Double vision that, at higher levels, forces the user to close one eye if they need to read or perceive fine visual details\n\nVisual disconnection is often accompanied by other coinciding effects, such as cognitive disconnection and physical disconnection. This results in the sensation that one is partially or completely detaching from both their sensory input and their conscious faculties. It is a near-universal effect under the influence of moderate dosages of dissociative compounds, such as ketamine, PCP, and DXM.\n\nAt its higher levels, visual disconnection can become all-encompassing in its effects. This results in a complete perceptual disconnection from one's sense of sight, which can be described as the experience of being completely blinded and unable to tell whether the eyes are open or closed due to a total lack of sensory input. During this state, the effect often leads one into the experience of finding themselves floating through a dark and mostly empty hallucinatory void.\n\nHoles, spaces and voids are a sub-component of visual disconnection that manifest when it has become all-encompassing in its intensity. This experience is more commonly known as a \"K-hole\"\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\nand is generally discussed as something that is specifically associated with ketamine, despite being present within most traditional dissociatives. A K-hole can be described as the place a person finds themselves in once visual disconnection becomes powerful enough to leave the person incapable of receiving external sensory input, replacing their visual input with a space that subjectively feels as if it is outside of normal reality.\n\nThe visual appearance of this space, hole, or void can be described as a vast, mostly empty and darkened chamber that often feels and appears to be infinite in size. This space is usually dark black in its colour, but can occasionally display itself with large patches of slow-moving amorphous colour clouds or subtle geometric patterns across its horizon. At its higher levels, these voids are often populated with hallucinatory structures, which are comprehensively described and documented in the subsection below.\n\nAlongside this visual experience, changes in gravity and a powerful sense of tactile disconnection are also usually present. This can result in one feeling as if they are undergoing an out-of-body experience while weightlessly floating through a void over great distances in a variety of different speeds, directions, and orientations. This is a feeling that is interpreted by many people as floating through space or the night sky.\n\nStructures are the only feature found within what would otherwise be completely empty and uninhabited voids. These manifest as monolithic 3-dimensional shapes or structures of an infinite variety and size that float above, below, around, or in front of a person as they gradually zoom, rotate, transform, or pan into focus, gradually unveiling before the person's line of sight.\n\nThese structures can take the form of any shape, but common examples include vast and giant pillars, columns, tunnels, blocks, buildings, slides, monuments, wheels, pyramids, caves, and a variety of abstract shapes. They are often fractal in shape and can manifest in a variety of colours, but usually follow darker themes and tones with an associated aesthetic that is sometimes subjectively interpreted as \"alien\" in nature.\n\nStructures can be broken down into the 4 basic levels of complexity and visual intensity described below:\n\nStructures typically display themselves anywhere between 30 seconds to several minutes before the person experiencing them slips back into reality or into the presence of another structure. In terms of how these structures shift between each other, their transition processes can be broken down into 4 basic categories. These are described and documented below:\n\n*  - Structures can switch between each other by transforming or shapeshifting in a static and comprehensible way. This is something that usually unfolds in a gradual step-by-step morphing process.\n\n*  - Structures can switch between each other by remaining completely static in their shape and simply panning out of view until they are no longer within one's field of vision. It’s from here that another structure usually comes into view from outside of one's peripheral vision within a few seconds to a couple of minutes.\n\n*  - Structures can switch between each other by disassembling into many tiny sections that resemble pixels, or building blocks. This occurs in a manner that is reminiscent of smoke or dust blowing in the wind. When forming through this style, the structure will appear to assemble itself step-by-step, becoming increasingly complex as it occurs.\n\n*  - The third method of transitioning is experienced when the structures appear to be stationary whilst one is floating silently between them over what can feel like extreme physical distances. This floating is sometimes felt to occur on an invisible rail through the vast and infinite dissociative hole.\""

These specific pieces of information are usually felt and understood to be a profound unveiling of an undeniable truth at the time. Afterward, however, they are often found to be meaningless, nonsensical, or delusional. Although, genuine lessons or coherent messages can occasionally be taken away from these experiences. It’s extremely important to note that the scientific validity of these lessons is very uncertain and should never be immediately accepted as true without an extremely thorough and sober analysis.\n\nPerceived exposure to inner mechanics of consciousness is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as ego death and high level geometry.

		"text": "Visual exposure to semantic concept network is the experience of percieving a seemingly infinite mass of complex interconnected geometric forms which are comprised entirely of innately understandable representations. Together, these individual geometric representations are perceived to simultaneously convey every internally stored concept and memory contained within the mind.\n\nAt its lower end, this effect is something that fluctuates wildly and is neither constant or consistent in its intensity. Instead, it is momentarily triggered by the experience of a concept. For example, if someone were to say the word \"Internet\" to a person who is currently undergoing this state, they would see the mind's concept of the Internet immediately manifested in a geometric form amidst the very centre of their visual field. This form will then quickly branch out from itself in a manner similar to a spider diagram or mind map chart.\n\nFor example, the concept \"Internet\" may have dozens of immediate child nodes that are representative of computers, which may have associated descendant nodes involving technologies. This may branch out further to include concepts representing human intelligence, which may then branch out into concepts related to the evolution of humanity, and so on until all concepts known to the person are represented within the network.\n\nOnce this occurs, the sensory overload can temporarily disconnect one from their external environment and result in simultaneous long-term memory suppression, or \"ego death\",  for several seconds to a minute before a person is briefly returned to reality. This is usually triggered again and again in quick succession. However, it is worth noting that this process can, to a certain extent, be disabled through continuous physical movements. This may be because movement stops the process of thoughts branching out by not giving one's brain the time it needs to lock onto new concepts as it is focused on movement rather than processing thoughts.\n\nAs the dose of the psychoactive substance is increased, the process becomes easier to trigger while extending its length and duration. This eventually results in a stable state of complete disconnection from the external environment alongside sustained \"ego death\", as well as feelings of experiencing \"all of existence\" in a single instant.\n\nVisual exposure to inner mechanics of consciousness is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as ego death and high level geometry. It is most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of stimulating psychedelic compounds with little hallucinatory content, such as LSD, 2C-B, and 4-HO-MET."

		"text": "Visual twisting is a distortion of a person's field of view, in which regions of one’s visual space appear to be curling or spiraling about a common center. This effect varies in its intensity, ranging from subtle and barely visible to extreme and all-encompassing. At its stronger levels, visual twisting can render an individual unable to resolve objects or have any sense of depth perception, completely impairing their sense of sight.\n\nVisual twisting is often accompanied by other coinciding effects, such as drifting and visual stretching. It is most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogenic compounds, such as psychedelics, dissociatives, and deliriants."
