	summary:
		'Colour enhancement is a perceived intensification of the brightness and vividness of colours in the external environment. During this experience, reds may seem “redder”, greens may seem “greener", and all colours will likely appear much more distinct, complex, and visually intense than they comparatively would during everyday sober living. At higher levels, this effect can sometimes result in seeing colours that are perceived as surreal or seemingly impossible.'
