# Experimental Server

The very long time ago I spent quite much time learning `V` as my back-end programming language,
I really love it however no company will use it for like next 10 years
so I've decided to build actual server with my favorite language.
Currently I really wish to just do a basic functionality for the server in TypeScript
and then start rewriting it to `V` -
I know there will be tons of challenges in terms of package support and so on,
but considering moments where I was using Prisma from version 0.5 where nothing literally worked and there was really no
alternatives in ecosystem - I was doing things by my way for my needs, I expect to do same here - this time missing
parts will be released as separate packages to support open-source ecosystem for V.

Up to this day plans aren't clearâ€”maybe this will be just a simple microservice for some part of application
or whole rewrite itself.
