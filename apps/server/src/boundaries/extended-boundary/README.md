## Layers

Certainly! Here's a breakdown of example classes or components you might find in each of the layers in a typical server-side application structured using Domain-Driven Design (DDD):

1. **User Interface (UI) / Presentation Layer:**
    - **Controllers**: Classes that handle incoming HTTP requests, validate input, and return responses.
    - **ViewModels**: Simple objects that represent the data to be displayed on a UI screen or transferred over the network.
    - **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Objects used for transferring data between processes, which can be tailored to the specific needs of the UI.
    - **Mappers**: Classes or functions responsible for translating domain objects to view models/DTOs and vice versa.
    - **Views**: In web applications, these are typically the HTML templates or components that render the user interface.

2. **Application Layer:**
    - **Application Services**: Classes that perform application-specific tasks, orchestrate domain objects, and direct the flow of operations within the application.
    - **Commands/Queries**: Objects that encapsulate the data needed for a specific operation, often used in CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) patterns.
    - **Command Handlers/Query Handlers**: Classes that handle specific commands or queries, usually by invoking domain layer operations.
    - **DTOs for Input/Output**: Similar to those in the UI layer but tailored for internal application communication.

3. **Domain Layer:**
    - **Aggregates**: Groupings of domain entities and value objects that form a cluster around a particular root entity.
    - **Entities**: Classes that represent objects with a distinct identity that runs through a thread of continuity.
    - **Value Objects**: Classes that represent descriptive aspects of the domain with no conceptual identity, immutable.
    - **Domain Services**: Classes encapsulating domain logic that doesn't naturally fit within an entity or value object.
    - **Domain Events**: Classes that represent something significant that has happened within the domain.
    - **Repositories (Interfaces)**: Abstractions for how aggregates are retrieved and persisted; the actual implementations belong to the infrastructure layer.
    - **Factories**: Classes or methods that handle the creation of complex domain objects and ensure they are in a valid state.

4. **Infrastructure Layer:**
    - **Repository Implementations**: Concrete implementations of the repository interfaces defined in the domain layer, often using an ORM like Entity Framework or Hibernate.
    - **Unit of Work**: Classes that manage transactions and coordinate the writing of data changes at the end of a business transaction.
    - **Data Mappers**: Infrastructure code that translates between the database and the domain models.
    - **Service Proxies**: Classes that handle the communication with external services or APIs.
    - **Infrastructure Services**: Concrete implementations of services like email senders, logging, caching, etc.

5. **Persistence Layer (a specialized part of the Infrastructure Layer):**
    - **Data Models**: Anemic models that represent the database schema, often used with an ORM to map to database tables.
    - **Migrations**: Classes that define the changes to be applied to the database schema over time.
    - **Database Context**: In frameworks like Entity Framework, this represents a session with the underlying database using ORM.
    - **DAOs (Data Access Objects)**: If not using an ORM, these are classes that provide an abstract interface to the database.

In a well-designed DDD application, the separation of concerns is maintained by ensuring each layer only knows about and interacts with the layer immediately below it. Abstractions (interfaces) are often used to facilitate this separation and enable loose coupling.
