    The View Model is a concept commonly used in the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern.
    It is designed specifically for the View layer and is used to encapsulate data that will be presented on a UI (User Interface).
    The View Model may include data that is a combination or a subset of the data from one or more domain models or DTOs.
    It often contains presentation logic for the view, such as visibility flags, display formats, and command actions that are specific to the UI.
    The View Model is typically not used for transferring data between different layers of the application; it's more focused on the needs of the view.


    Purpose: View Models are UI specific, while DTOs are designed to carry data between various parts of a system or across network boundaries.
    Logic: View Models can contain presentation logic, whereas DTOs are typically "dumb" objects without such logic.
    Scope of Use: View Models are used within the MVVM pattern or similar UI patterns. DTOs are more widely used and not tied to any specific architectural pattern.
