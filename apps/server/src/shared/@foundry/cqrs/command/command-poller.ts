/** Command poller is a component that initiates long-polling requests to the server to retrieve new commands from
 *  the command queue. It periodically sends a request to the server, waits for a response, and retrieves any new
 * commands that are available. The command poller can be implemented using asynchronous mechanisms such as timers,
 * event-driven architectures, or dedicated long-polling libraries. */
