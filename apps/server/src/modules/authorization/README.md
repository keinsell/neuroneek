# RBAC, ABAC, ACL, and PBAC

Authorization determines whether a known individual can perform a specific action. After logging in, the user has been
authenticated, but they still need to be authorized each time they try to create a new user, assign a permission or
access a sensitive resource.

- Actor: who is performing the action? User("Ariana")

- Action: what are they trying to do? "push"

- Resource: what are they doing it to? Repository("Acme App")
