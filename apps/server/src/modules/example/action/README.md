Actions represent the Use Cases of the Application (i.e., the actions that can be performed by a user or software in the
application).

Actions can hold business logic and/or orchestrate the tasks to perform the business logic.

Actions take data structures as inputs, manipulate them according to the business rules, and output new data structures.

Actions should not be concerned with how the data is gathered or how it will be represented.

By looking at the Actions folder of a Container, you can determine what use cases (features) your Container provides. By
looking at all the Actions, you can tell what an application can do.
