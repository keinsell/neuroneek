Views contain the HTML served by your application.

Their main goal is to separate the application logic from the presentation logic. (They are the V in MVC).

Views receive data from the Controller and use it to generate the HTML that will be sent to the client's browser. Views
can also include template files that define the structure and layout of the HTML, making it easier to maintain
consistency across multiple pages.
