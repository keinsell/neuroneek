Transformers, short for Response Transformers, are equivalent to Views but for JSON Responses. While Views take data and
represent it in HTML, Transformers take data and represent it in JSON.

Transformers are responsible for transforming Models into Arrays. They take a Model or a group of Models "Collection"
and convert it to a formatted serializable Array.
