	 * Chemical nomenclature is the system of naming chemical compounds. The rules for naming compounds vary depending on the type of compound, but in general, they are based on the type and number of atoms present in the compound, as well as the chemical bonds between them. The most common system of chemical nomenclature is the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) system, which is widely used in scientific literature and in industry.
