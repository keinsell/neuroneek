# `server`

## Goal

Overload server which as big amount of features as it is possible to resue as much code as it's possible in future,
program in decoupled way to allow easy testing and development, and have fun while doing it.

## Features

- **üç≠ Eye Candies**, who would like to look at a boring wall of text all the time, since start of application it gives
  you
  nice and friendly developer feel, as all of us - keeping candies for ourselves so these features are disabled
  for "serious" deployments.
- **"Where is the fucking documentation?"**, no fucking more fellas, there you have static documentation dedicated for
  Angular-like projects (`compodoc`), static generation of `GraphQL` documentation, `Swagger` documentation for REST
  API, and `eventsdoc` for event-driven applications. I would like to document websockets with `asyncapi` but sorry
  ecosystem isn't ready for that yet. I mean... You still can completly do not give a fuck about documentation and will
  hear such thing but I think you can say you tried at least lol
