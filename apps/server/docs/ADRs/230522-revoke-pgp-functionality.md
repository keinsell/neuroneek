# ADR: Revoke PGP-related Functionality

After longs chain of thought I've finally decided to revoke functionalities related to PGP encryption, this would be
valid method for ensuring data of users are properly encrypted and available only for them, however when it comes to
**Key Revocation** and **Key Rotation** we have a little troubles.

Instead as a potential solution I would rather think about **Symmetric Key Encryption**, **Homomorphic Encryption**
or maybe **Tokenization** - future of encryption isn't clear at this moment and more research is needed.
