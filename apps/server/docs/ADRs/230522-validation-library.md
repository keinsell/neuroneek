# Validation Library Selection

## Context

As we embark on the development of our TypeScript project, we recognize the importance of implementing robust validation mechanisms to ensure the integrity and consistency of our data. Several validation libraries are available for TypeScript, each offering different features and trade-offs. To make an informed decision, we have identified the potential candidates for our project as follows:

- class-validator
- io-ts
- newtypes-ts
- superstruct
- runtypes
- zod

## Considerations

In selecting a validation library, we need to take into account various factors to ensure that it aligns with our project requirements and objectives. Here are some considerations to keep in mind:

1. **Ease of Use**: We should prioritize a library that provides a straightforward and intuitive API for defining and applying validation rules. The library should facilitate the validation process without introducing unnecessary complexity.

2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript offers strong static typing capabilities, and it is essential to leverage this feature in our validation library. The selected library should integrate well with TypeScript and provide type safety guarantees throughout the validation process.

3. **Validation Features**: Different libraries may offer various validation features, such as support for nested objects, custom validators, conditional validation rules, and more. We should evaluate which features are essential for our project and ensure that the chosen library adequately supports them.

4. **Performance**: The efficiency of the validation library is crucial, especially when dealing with large datasets or high-traffic applications. We should consider the performance characteristics of each library and evaluate their impact on the overall application performance.

5. **Community Support and Documentation**: A vibrant community around a library can provide valuable support, documentation, and a repository of reusable code snippets. It is beneficial to select a library that has an active community and comprehensive documentation to help us overcome challenges and optimize our development process.

6. **Maintainability and Longevity**: It is important to choose a library that is actively maintained and has a roadmap for future development. This ensures that we can rely on continuous updates, bug fixes, and improvements in the library, reducing the risk of technical debt.

## Evaluation and Decision

Given the number of potential candidates and the complexity of evaluating each one, it is prudent to postpone the final decision on the validation library. We should allocate some time to conduct further research, experiment with different options, and potentially seek recommendations from the TypeScript community.

During this period, we can explore the documentation and examples provided by each library, assess their ease of integration with our existing codebase, and even create small prototypes to evaluate their performance and usability. This exploration phase will help us make a well-informed decision based on practical experience and concrete evidence.

## Conclusion

The validation library selection is an important decision for our TypeScript project. Considering the factors mentioned above, namely ease of use, type safety, validation features, performance, community support, and maintainability, we will defer the final decision until we have conducted thorough research and experimentation.

By postponing the decision, we can ensure that we make the best choice for our project's specific requirements, reducing the risk of introducing unnecessary complexities or limitations.
