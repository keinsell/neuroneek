# Effects

### Why reinvent the wheel when there's already plenty of wheels out there?

Websites like https://effectindex.com and https://psychonautwiki.org providing a lot of useful information about subjective effects that you can feel, however data contained in these websites is okay for humans but when it comes to including these informations to dataset for ex. in machine learning, it's hard to use. I would like to keep these information in easy accessible form that would be possible to use for machine learning or any other purpose which may be useful for psychodelic researchers.

I understand why these websites adopted such form as it's extermally hard to find unified data structure that would allow to store
complex information about subjective feelings howver I do not think it's impossible.
