The Neuronek project was reactivated this month after a year-long hiatus. Previously, I had deemed the project a \"waste of time\" as pen and paper sufficed for my needs. However, [recent issues highlighted the project's broken state](https://github.com/keinsell/neuronek/issues/406), and renewed interest prompted me to reconsider. I've decided to dedicate more time to Neuronek and potentially push it to production, as the core idea still holds merit.
