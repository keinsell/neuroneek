Code of Conflict
----------------

Effort in this project is a personal matter and it never meant to be build with community. Contributions from people out of founder's circle are highly unwelcomed and it's strongly disadvised to contribute into this project.

If however, anyone feels personally abused, threatened, or otherwise
uncomfortable due to this process, that is not acceptable and right actions will be taken on such behaviour. There's line between personal abuse and criticism (even if said in unexpected way).

We are all humans, and frustrations can happen. Always remember there's human on the other side which may have bad day or other problems over the head.  Try to keep in mind the immortal words of Bill and Ted, "Be excellent to each other.

~ Inspired by Linus Torvald's Code of Conflict
