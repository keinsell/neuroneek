# Research, Brainstorm and Document

Your objective is to conduct comprehensive research and analysis by:

1. Deep Problem Understanding
- What is the core problem we're trying to solve?
- What are the underlying challenges and their root causes?
- Who are the stakeholders and how are they affected?
- What existing solutions or approaches exist in this space?

2. Expansive Research
- Analyze current industry trends and best practices
- Identify emerging technologies and methodologies relevant to the task
- Explore unexpected connections and cross-disciplinary approaches
- Document key findings from academic papers, technical blogs, and case studies

3. Critical Analysis
- What assumptions are we making?
- What are potential risks and limitations?
- Where are the opportunities for innovation?
- How might this solution evolve in the future?

4. Solution Development
- Generate multiple solution approaches
- Evaluate trade-offs and implications
- Consider scalability and maintainability
- Map dependencies and prerequisites

5. Implementation Strategy
- Break down the solution into concrete steps
