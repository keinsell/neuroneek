## Not so frequent questions and answers

### Why repository have so many unrelated pull requests?

Welp, there were too many ideas for time I had. I personally dropped project multiple times because was essentially
trying to make it much bigger for a startup point than it should
be. [Github do not allow for deletion of pull requests](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/28200#discussioncomment-7359175),
so this mess is eventually supposed to say there - and since there actual stargazers recreation of repository do not
seem to be the best thing to be done.
